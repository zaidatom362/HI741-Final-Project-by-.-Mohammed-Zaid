0,16755,591642,675629,"A 20-year-old Caucasian man with no medical history was admitted for elective surgery of a chordoma that extended from the sphenoidal sinus to the anterior face of C2. The first surgical step consisted of a subtotal removal of the tumour by a transfrontal approach. An EVD was inserted at day 1 (D1) because of the appearance of hydrocephalia.
At D10, the second approach consisted in a transoral resection of the tumour with a reconstruction of the pharyngeal wall with skin taken from the arm. However, the wall was not totally occlusive, with a continuous CSF leak into the pharyngeal cavity. Seven days later (D17), the patient developed meningitis with fever and a white blood cell count of 13,800/mm3. CSF withdrawn through the ventricular drain showed CSF leukocytes at 830/mm3, a CSF protein concentration of 0.99 g/l and a CSF glucose concentration of 3 mmol/l (for a glycaemia of 6 mmol/l). A Ps. aeruginosa O12 resistant to almost all antibiotics except ceftazidime and polymyxin B, similar to that repeatedly found in the oral cavity, grew in CSF culture. It was therefore decided to replace the ventricular drain with another in the controlateral hemisphere for two purposes: first, to withdraw CSF to reduce CSF leakage by the fistula, and second, to perform a biochemical and bacteriological analysis. Antibiotherapy was started with intravenous (i.v.) ceftazidime (6 g/day for 2 days, followed by 8 g/day for 25 days) combined with amikacin and polymyxin B both in the ventricles.
A clear improvement in the meningitis allowed us to perform the third and last approach (at D42): an occipito-cervical fixation procedure with EVD removed. Three days later (D45), the patient developed a new episode of hydrocephalia. It was therefore decided to introduce ELD rather than EVD.
Twelve days later (D57), the patient developed a second episode of meningitis: fever, lumbar CSF leukocytes at 14,000/mm3, a CSF protein concentration of 1.88 g/l and a glucose concentration of 0.9 mmol/l (for a glycaemia of 6 mmol/l). A CSF culture found the same bacteria as in the first episode of meningitis. This second episode was considered to be related to the persistent pharyngeal fistula. The ELD was replaced with a new one and EVD was added because of the suspicion of an additional obstruction in the 4th ventricle related to post-surgical oedema. Meningitis was treated with an increasing dose of i.v. ciprofloxacin (from D61 to D95: 1.2 g continuously over 24 hours for 4 days, followed by 2.4 g over 24 hours for a further 31 days) and i.v. cefepim (from D61 to D95: 4 × 2 g/day for 4 days to 4 × 3 g/day for a further 31 days; see below for the inhibitory minimal concentration and the plasma and CSF concentrations of antibiotics) and amikacine and polymyxin B colistine both administered directly into the ventricles.
The third episode of meningitis appeared at D66 with identification of the same Ps. aeruginosa O12 in CSF culture, increased CSF protein and decreased CSF glucose levels in both ELD and EVD. Antibiotics were kept constant and, despite negative cultures, ELD and EVD were replaced with new drains. Interestingly, since this last episode of meningitis, the pharyngeal fistula disappeared, which indicated the end of pharyngeal contamination of CSF. The patient improved rapidly and was discharged home at D108. No further episode of meningitis during the next 3 years, nor any toxic effect related to the high doses of antibiotics, was observed. It is noteworthy that repetitive cerebral computed tomography scans showed no empyema.
Figure shows the time course of the following parameters: leukocyte counts, glucose and protein concentrations, measured in parallel in CSF from EVD and ELD, for 17 days (D57 to D73) corresponding to the second and third episodes of meningitis. Figure shows strikingly that the leukocytes and the protein concentration were always higher and the glucose concentration was always lower in ELD than in EVD. Interestingly, the highest ventriculo-lumbar CSF gradients in leukocytes, protein and glucose concentration were present at the very acute phase of meningitis, when Ps. aeruginosa O12 was present in the meningeal cavity.
Our case also showed that the increase in the amount of antibiotics given did increase their concentration in plasma but not in CSF. Indeed, i.v. cefepim was increased from 8 to 12 g/day and i.v. ciprofloxacin from 1.2 to 2.4 g/day from D64 to D95. This induced a persistent increase in plasma cefepim concentration from 46 μ g/ml to more than 60 μg/ml and plasma ciprofloxacin concentration from 0.2 μg/ml to more than 1.0 μg/ml. However, only a transient increase in cefepim concentration (D63, 7 μg/ml; D73, 15 μg/ml; D81 and D95, less than 9 μg/ml) and no increase in ciprofloxacin concentration (0.4–0.5 μg/ml from D63 to 95) were seen in lumbar and ventricular CSF. It is noteworthy that the inhibitory minimal concentrations of cefepim and ciprofloxacin for Ps. aeruginosa O12 were 16 and 0.25 mg/ml, respectively."
1,16755,890528,956118,"A 12-year-old boy presented with a grossly swollen and deformed left elbow after sustaining a fall off skateboard and directly landed on the elbow. There was no neurovascular deficit in the extremity. The anteroposterior and lateral radiographs showed posterolateral dislocation of the left elbow in association with Milch type II lateral condyle fracture (Figure and Figure ). Concomitant elbow dislocation was managed by closed reduction. The stability of elbow was assessed under general anaesthesia.
Open K-wiring of the lateral condylar fracture was carried out on the same day of injury (Figure and Figure ). A standard lateral approach to the distal humerus and elbow joint was used. Under direct visualization, the fracture was anatomically reduced and held in place. Two smooth 0.0625-inch Kirschner wires (K-wires) were inserted from lateral to medial and distal to proximal directions. The positions of the K-wires were verified by fluoroscopic examination in the anteroposterior and lateral planes. The K-wires were then cut and left exposed outside the skin.
The operated elbow was immobilized in an above elbow backslab postoperatively. A close clinico-radiological follow-up at one and two weeks postoperatively was instituted and confirmed no loss of reduction. K-wires were removed under general anaesthesia four and half weeks postoperatively. At 39 months follow up, the elbow had normal appearance and functions with no alteration in the carrying angle and no symptoms."
2,16758,165876,575754,"Case 1, the oldest child of the non-consanguine family, a 17-year-old girl, has a double-chambered right ventricle, multiple vertebral malformations of the thoracic and lumbal spine and epileptic seizures. She also shows severe mental retardation, microcephaly, facial dysmorphology (long underdeveloped philtrum, broad nasal bridge, micrognathism, high palate, divergent strabism) and stunted growth."
3,16758,118326,859881,"Case 4, an 11-year-old girl, presented with microcephaly and facial dysmorphology (long underdeveloped philtrum, broad nasal bridge, micrognathism, dysplastic ear helices, strabism), partial deafness, mental retardation, absence epilepsy and stunted growth."
4,28617,843435,791338,"Case 5, an 8-year-old girl, was slightly mentally retarded and microcephalic, with minor facial anomalies and short stature."
5,28617,347907,403256,"Case 6, a 5-year-old boy, was a preterm baby and small for gestational age. He also presented with microcephaly, facial dysmorphology and micrognathism. Brachydactyly and clinodactyly of the fifth fingers of both hands were noted.
The mother had one miscarriage between her 6th child and our index patient, case 7. The stillbirth occurred in the 7th month of pregnancy.
Further diagnostic work-up in case 1 to 7 was unremarkable. Because of the characteristic features of all her children, maternal serum phe concentration was analysed. The blood phe level was greatly elevated with 1560 μmol/L (normal < 90 μmol/L). Urinary organic acid analysis showed high excretion of phenylpyruvic, phenylacetic, hydroxyphenylacetic and phenyllactic acids as well as mandelic acid. Mutation analysis revealed that the mother was compound hetereozygous for the mutations L48S and P281L in the PAH gene. This disease was previously unknown to the mother. A newborn screening program had not yet been established in 1963 in Albania when the mother was born. The mother did not wish to maintain a phe-restrictive or protein-restrictive diet, and the children were unavailable to us for a long-term follow-up."
6,29447,337654,681159,"A 53-year-old man noticed some swelling of his face. A chest x-ray showed a large mass projecting over the right lung field (fig ). A CT scan of the chest showed an enormous anterior mediastinal mass contiguous with the posterior aspect of the sternum and the right ribs, occluding the superior vena cava and compressing the heart (fig ). Blood tests were normal, tumor markers and Acetyl Choline Receptor Antibodies were negative. The patient underwent bronchoscopy and the biopsy showed the features of a carcinoid tumor.
He underwent excision of the tumor, which required resection of the superior vena cava and insertion of a graft, resection of the right phrenic nerve and plication of the diaphragm.
The finding at surgery was an enormous spherical tumor with an extremely vascular capsule due to the venous collaterals. The tumor was 20 cm from pole to pole and 15 cm in diameter. On the left it bulged into the left pleural space, displacing the phrenic nerve laterally. Superiorly it obliterated the left innominate vein and extend into the strap muscles. There was an enlarged lymph node. On the right it had obliterated the confluence of the innominate veins and the first centimeter or so of the superior vena cava. It enclosed the phrenic nerve over its complete length and was adherent to the medial aspects of the upper and middle lobes of the right lung. There was some thickening of the visceral pleura in this area and there appeared to be some superficial infiltration. Posteriorly it was adherent to the pericardium and there was some thickening of the ascending aorta, consistent with longstanding pressure effects. There was a small bloody pericardial effusion and a rather large right pleural effusion. There was no evidence of any pleural deposits or intrapericardial deposits.
The histology of the resection specimen showed a tumor weighing 2.1 kg. The tumor appeared encapsulated with an irregular surface. The tumor invaded the surrounding fat and pleura. There was infiltration into the underlying lung tissue lymphatics. There was some residual thymic tissue within the surrounding fat. Metastatic deposits were found in the right hilar lymph node and the node removed from the left cervical horn of the thymus. The tumor was classified as an atypical carcinoid of the thymus (neuroendocrine carcinoma of intermediate grade 2).
One month later he underwent a CT scan of the chest. There were findings consistent with a recent sternotomy and a graft of the superior vena cava. There was a fluid filled cyst at the base of the right lung and areas of atelectasis and pleural thickening were noted in both lungs.
An I-123 MIBG scan was performed with negative results for detection of any residual or recurrent pathology.
He was treated with postoperative radiotherapy and chemotherapy.
One year later, a follow-up CT scan of the chest was obtained with no findings of recurrence or abnormal lymph nodes in the mediastinum. Linear atelectasis was detected in the lower lobes of both lungs and elevation of the right hemi diaphragm was noted. In addition a bone scan was performed with a positive finding at the posterior arch of the 8th right rib. The patient was advised to have a SRS, for a more accurate evaluation of his status, as it was considered that ""functional"" imaging performed by Nuclear Medicine examinations, might detect pathological processes earlier than ""structural"" images, such as CT.
Spot images of head-neck, thorax, abdomen and lumbar region were obtained 3 hr after injection of 5 mCi In-111-DTPA-D-Phe 1-pentetreotide. The scan was carried out on a Sopha single headed tomographic gamma camera coupled to a dedicated NXT computer system. Spot images of the areas of interest were obtained with a high-energy all-purpose collimator using 20% windows centered at 171 and 245 keV.
The SRS was reported as showing an area of abnormally increased concentration of the radiopharmaceutical at the anatomical area of the mediastinum due to either a mass remnant or a recurrence of the disease or an inflammatory process (fig. ). The bone scan finding did not take up the radiopharmaceutical. A repeat bone scan after a further 9 months was negative.
Thus, the main questions that we had to answer were: is there a mass remnant, or a recurrence of the disease? and, can we exclude a metastatic lesion at the site of the finding on the bone scan?"
7,29447,296075,120406,"A 26 year-old woman was referred to our maternal and fetal unit for detailed ultrasonographic examination because of triplet pregnancy with threatened abortion at 15 weeks of gestation. Her obstetric history included two first trimester abortions. The patient had taken no medication or drug for ovulation induction. An inquiry into the family history revealed that her mother had delivered triplet babies all of whom died in the early neonatal period. In the present case, the attending obstetrician had performed an ultrasonography at 6 weeks of gestation demonstrating a single, 17 × 20 mm gestational sac (chorion) (Figure ).
Detailed ultrasonography at our maternal and fetal unit revealed a monochorionic triamniotic triplet pregnancy. Three thin amniotic membranes and an ipsilon zone were detected. The biometric measurements of the three distinct fetuses were appropriate for 15 weeks of gestation. The parents were informed about the risks of a multiple pregnancy and monochorionic placentation. After three days' hospitalization, the vaginal bleeding ceased and the patient was discharged to follow-up.
The obstetric course was unremarkable until 24 weeks, when ultrasonographic examination revealed that one of the triplet fetuses had developed a multicystic lung lesion suggestive of CCAM, with the largest cyst measuring 10 mm in diameter (Figure ). Until 30 weeks of gestation, the fetuses had appropriate growth, and follow-up of the pregnancy was uneventful except that the fetus with CCAM developed mild polyhydramnios. At 30 weeks, the patient presented with preterm uterine contractions that ceased after tocolysis with nifedipine 60 mg per day. Betamethasone (12 mg × 2 doses in 24 hours) was administered intramuscularly to the mother to promote fetal lung maturation. The patient was readmitted to our unit at 34 weeks for uterine contractions and impaired fetal growth. The size of the lung lesion remained the same at that time. At 35 weeks of gestation, the patient underwent a low-transverse caesarean section and delivered three live male babies with birth weights 1560 g, 1580 g and 1590 g. Apgar scores were 7/9, 6/8 and 7/9 at 1 and 5 minutes, respectively. A single placenta weighing 1080 g and three distinct membranes were demonstrated (Figure ). Pathological examination confirmed monochorionic triamniotic placentation. The postnatal course was uneventful and the patient was discharged four days postpartum. Two newborns were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit for respiratory distress, the third one died due to sepsis on day 7 postpartum. One of the triplets was discharged healthy 42 days postpartum.
The newborn with multicystic lung lesions developed unilateral pneumothorax which was treated by inserting an intercostal drain, and was discharged from the hospital after one month. Computerized tomography (CT) of the infant at 3 months demonstrated two cystic lesions in the middle lobe of the right lung (25 mm and 15 mm in diameter) (Figure ). A repeat CT of the infant at 6 months showed a 30 mm solitary cystic mass (Figure )."
8,42952,84507,457649,"A 47-year-old male was transferred from another ICU due to multiple chest injuries after a car accident, respiratory tract infection, and ICU polyneuropathy. Based on clinical and microbiological evidence, therapy for severe pneumonia was initiated on the 2nd day of the ICU stay, with a combination of imipenem/cilastatin, gentamicin, ofloxacin and vancomycin that were given for 10, 22, 6 and 14 days respectively. Imipenem/cilastatin was substituted with piperacillin/tazobactam given for 12 days, and piperacillin/tazobactam was then substituted with ceftriaxone given for 10 days. On the 30th day teicoplanin was added to the regimen, given for 21 days. On the 40th day of the ICU stay, a PDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain was isolated from his bronchial secretions. He was subsequently treated, due to the persistence of the infection, with a prolonged course of intravenous colistin for a total of 52 days, combined with imipenem/cilastatin for 12 days, then meropenem for 23 days and then ofloxacin for 16 days. On the 54th day a strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa sensitive only to colistin (COS) was isolated from his bronchial secretions. The infection was gradually controlled and, finally, the patient was discharged from the hospital in a good condition."
9,42952,657415,256899,"A 47-year-old female was admitted to the ICU due to possible meningitis. She had been operated for meningioma and had a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt. The shunt was removed at the day of admission with simultaneous insertion of external cerebrospinal fluid drainage. The initial cultures of CSF specimens were negative. The patient was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and vancomycin. A CSF specimen, taken on the 24th day of ICU stay, grew a MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain (sensitive only to colistin and piperacillin/tazobactam, intermediate sensitive to imipenem and meropenem) and ceftriaxone was substituted with piperacillin/tazobactam and meropenem. Due to deterioration of her clinical condition several combinations of antimicrobial agents were subsequently given, including ciprofloxacin for 19 days, chloramphenicol for 11 days, colistin for 23 days, and gentamicin for 6 days. On the 62nd day of the ICU stay, a PDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain was isolated from a cerebrospinal fluid specimen. Until the isolation of the PDR strain, repeated CSF specimen cultures grew MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa. A gradual change in the Pseudomonas susceptibility was observed from multidrug-resistance to pandrug-resistance. The patient died on the 66th day of hospitalisation due to Pseudomonas meningitis."
10,50194,500834,46366,"An 18-year-old male was admitted to the ICU with fractures of the 2nd and 3rd cervical vertebrae and concomitant acute respiratory failure type I. Pneumonia was diagnosed clinically and confirmed microbiologically. Staphylococcus aureus and COS Acinetobacter baumannii were repeatedly isolated from bronchial secretions during the second and the third week of his hospitalization, respectively. Different combinations of antibiotics were provided, due to the persistence of severe pneumonia. The antibiotics were vancomycin, broad-spectrum cephalosporins, clindamycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, aminoglycosides, quinolones, meropenem and colistin (given for a total of 21, 15, 9, 7, 25, 7, 6 and 11 days respectively, up to the 34th day of ICU stay). On the 34th day of ICU stay PDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa grew from his bronchial secretions. At that time, he was receiving colistin, meropenem, ofloxacin and gentamicin. He continued to receive the same antimicrobial combination. PDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa was not isolated again from subsequent cultures of bronchial secretions. Instead, Acinetobacter baumannii grew again from bronchial secretions on the 35th day of hospitalization and in subsequent cultures by the 45th day of ICU stay. Meanwhile a gradual improvement of the infection was noted. The patient was transferred to a specialized orthopedic center after 78 days of ICU stay, in good general condition, without evidence of pneumonia or other infection."
11,50194,276638,511842,"A 72-year-old female was admitted to the ICU with a complicated, severe urinary tract infection (UTI) due to COS Pseudomonas aeruginosa and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). During the last trimester, she had been hospitalized twice for episodes of UTIs. Treatment with intravenous colistin and meropenem was initiated on ICU admission and 15 days later urine specimen cultures were negative. However, due to persistence of fever the treatment was continued. Vancomycin was added to the regimen after isolation of Enterococcus faecium from cultures of the tip of the central venous catheter (CVC) on the 8th day of ICU stay. On the 33rd day, PDR Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated from the tip of the CVC. Due to unavailability of antimicrobial agents with in vitro effect against the pathogen, no change in the antimicrobial regimen was performed. Her clinical condition was complicated on the 37th day with lower respiratory tract infection and bacteremia due to COS Pseudomonas aeruginosa, for which a short course of gentamicin was added to the treatment. From the tip of the CVC, MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to all tested drugs (not tested for colistin) was isolated again on the 48th day, and COS Klebsiella pneumoniae on the 63rd day of ICU stay. Her clinical condition improved gradually, although COS Pseudomonas aeruginosa kept being isolated in cultures of bronchial secretions up to the 78th day of ICU stay. She was transferred in good condition to another hospital for continuation of her care, without fever or other clinical and laboratory evidence of infection, after 85 days of ICU stay."
12,58133,962934,661621,"A 56-year-old male was admitted to the ICU after elective operation for a thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm and intra-operative hemorrhage. On the 24th day of ICU stay the patient was re-operated for infection of the thoracotomy with pus collection, which required drainage. On the 52nd day PDR Klebsiella pneumoniae was isolated from bronchial secretions. He had already received 31 days of colistin treatment, combined with ampicillin/sulbactam (for 22 days) and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole (for 8 days), all given for treatment of polymicrobial pneumonia caused by MDR strains of Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae and bacteremia by MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae strain. By the time of isolation of the PDR microorganism the patient's condition was steadily deteriorating; eventually irreversible septic shock and multiple organ failure led to his death on the 68th day of ICU stay."
13,58133,718200,671748,"A 35-year-old male was transferred to our hospital from another medical center with infection of the lower respiratory tract and UTI due to COS Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The patient had a history of rupture of an aneurysm of the circle of Willis that was surgically managed. During his prolonged hospitalization, episodes of obstructive hydrocephalus and CNS infection complicated his clinical condition, which necessitated admission to the ICU. On the 32nd day of ICU stay, PDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from a urine specimen. By that time, he had received several combinations of antimicrobial agents, including 6 days of treatment with colistin, for lower respiratory tract infection with COS Pseudomonas aeruginosa. After isolation of the PDR pathogen he received combination treatment with colistin and ceftazidime leading to clinical cure of the UTI. The clinical condition of the patient gradually improved and he became afebrile. However, the patient's respiratory tract remained constantly colonized with MDR and COS Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. He was transferred to the neurosurgical ward after 134 days of ICU stay, in improved condition. Thirty days later, pneumonia relapsed and progressed into septic shock and multiple organ failure, and subsequent death."
14,68490,156571,553201,"An 82-year-old male was admitted in the nephrology clinic due to cellulitis of the right lower limb. The patient had a history of chronic renal failure and a recent episode of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). Blood specimen cultures performed on admission and 24 hours later, grew both PDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain. Treatment with intravenous piperacillin/tazobactam was initiated. A quick improvement of the cellulitis was noted. The therapeutic regimen was not changed when a result for isolation of a PDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain from the blood cultures became available. The patient was discharged to home after 10 days of treatment, with the cellulitis cured. In addition, subsequent blood cultures did not reveal any isolates."
15,68490,599776,733358,"A 47-year-old man was hospitalized in our intensive care unit (ICU) for generalized seizures and hypotension. Three days before admission, he suffered from fatigue, fever, vomiting, abdominal pain and lower GI hemorrhage. He was homeless and a chronic alcoholic. Physical examination showed general status impairment, with a temperature of 36.5°C and a Glasgow Coma Score of 10. No focal neurological deficit was noted. His blood pressure was 80/26 mmHg, his heart rate 106 /min and his respiratory rate 36 /min. His abdomen was tender with hepatomegaly. Usual blood tests showed a creatinine of 413 μmol/l (N <120), white blood cell count of 15.1 × 106 /l (N: 4 × 106-10 × 106) with 85% polymorphonuclear leukocytes, hemoglobin of 8.5 g/dl (N: 13–18) and platelets 178 × 106 /l (N: 150–400). He presented with severe lactic acidosis (arterial pH 7.21 (N: 7.34–7.45), PaCO2 3.7 kPa (N: 4.3–6.0), blood bicarbonate 11 mmol/l (N: 20–26), and plasma lactate 22 mmol/l (N: 1–2)). His prothrombin time was 9% (N>75%), fibrinogen 3.72 g/l (N: 2–4), factor V 25% (N >75%), and factors II + VII 5% (N >75%). Other tests showed an AST of 4,480 UI/l (N<50), an ALT of 2,340 UI/l (N<50), bilirubin 67 μmol/l (N<17), LDH 24,500 UI/l (N<275), lipase 11,820 UI/l (N<200), and creatine phosphokinase 3,330 UI/l (N<170). Abdominal ultrasonography showed an enlarged liver without ascites. The chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, cerebral CT scan were unremarkable. The patient was intubated. He received IV infusions of norepinephrine (6 mg/h), dobutamine (15 μg/kg/min), omeprazole (80 mg/day), N-acetylcysteine (300 mg/kg over 20 h), cefotaxime (3 g/day) and metronidazole (1.5 g/day). Continuous hemodiafiltration was started. Cultures of blood, urine, stools and tracheal aspiration were negative. Toxicological screening tests, including acetaminophen, ethanol, ethylene glycol, and methanol were negative. HIV-1 ELISA serology was positive, CD4+ lymphocytes count 160 × 106 /l (N >700), and HIV-1 RNA level was 5.8 × 105 copies/ml. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) showed 2.5 × 108 cells/l with 58% lymphocytes. A diagnosis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection was rapidly assessed by an amplification assay (Amplified Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Direct Test, Gen Probe, California) and retrospectively confirmed by BAL cultures. Isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide were started on day 3. Endoscopic examination showed grade II esophageal varices, moderate peptic esophagitis, erythematous gastritis with cardial superficial ulcerations without active bleeding, and normal duodenum and colon. CMV culture using MRC5 cells inoculation was positive in blood but not in BAL. CMV amplification assay was negative in the cerebrospinal fluid. Histopathologic analysis of a gastric biopsy showed edema, inflammatory infiltrate and typical intranuclear cytomegalic inclusion bodies in endothelial cells in mucosa. Immunohistochemistry with a specific anti-CMV antibody (E13, Argène, France) confirmed active CMV infection of the stomach (Fig. ). Specific staining and culture were negative for Helicobacter pylori. As soon as these results were known (on day 10), ganciclovir was started. Concomitant abdominal CT scan disclosed large and heterogeneous peripancreatic hypodensities, mildly enhanced following contrast infusion (Fig. ). However, their exact etiology remained undetermined. The patient developed hospital-acquired Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia and his condition worsened. He died 30 days after admission. Postmortem examination showed a large, well-circumscribed gastric perforation with a diameter of 4 cm. The stomach was solidly adhered to the transverse colon and to the lower face of the liver. There was a thick necrotic and hemorrhagic inflammatory coating around the pancreas, which, in contrast, appeared macroscopically normal. The whole GI tract, except the stomach, was normal.
CMV infection of the GI tract can cause severe damage. Isolated involvement of the stomach is possible, although rare [,]. Symptoms are not specific, including unexplained fever, dysphagia, sharp or postural epigastric pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and GI bleeding. Characteristic upper endoscopic findings are edema, congestion, mucosal ulcerations, multiple punched-out gastric ulcers, erosions, and upper GI hemorrhage []. However, findings may be mild showing congestion and thickening or be atypical, with hemorrhaged necrotic gastritis or pseudo-tumors []. Multiple mucosal biopsies are needed to detect CMV []. In HIV-infected patients, CMV is significantly associated with chronic active gastritis or gastroduodenal ulcers [-], in contrast with healthy adults, in whom symptomatic CMV gastric infection is exceptional []. Thus, early recognition of CMV GI infection, including blood cultures and cautious GI endoscopic evaluation, may allow for adequate therapy, preventing complications, such as life-threatening bleeding or perforation [,].
CMV infection activates endothelial cells and leukocytes, altering GI microcirculation and inducing extensive vasculitis, thrombotic vascular occlusion, necrosis, and ischemic perforation []. The most common reported locations of intestinal perforation are the colon (53%) [-], the distal ileum (40%) [,], and the appendix (7%) []. CMV-associated perforation of the stomach is a rare presentation []. To our knowledge, isolated CMV-induced gastric perforation has only been reported in non-HIV organ transplant recipients []. In our patient, CMV-associated gastric perforation, as a presenting manifestation of HIV infection, was responsible for multiorgan failure. The diagnosis was difficult, in the absence of acute abdomen and pneumoperitonium. Consistently, initial endoscopic examination missed the gastric perforation, since the hole in the stomach was probably filled in by peritoneum. Moreover it is possible that a suboptimal endoscopic evaluation of the upper GI tract was due to the patient's initial unstable condition and the performance of the gastroscopy in such a critical situation. In contrast, concomitant abdominal CT scan showed large hypodense images surrounding the pancreas, attributed after postmortem examination, to the hemorrhagic and necrotic inflammatory materials that filled in the gastric perforation.
Alternative causes of gastric ulcer, including Helicobacter pylori infection, should be discussed. Indeed, CMV is an opportunistic virus and may thus appear in previously damaged tissues. However, a recent study suggested that CMV, rather than Helicobacter pylori, may be the main causative pathogen of peptic ulcers in HIV-infected patients, in comparison to non HIV-infected ones []. In our case, histopathologic findings and cultures were negative for Helicobacter pylori. Moreover, CMV inclusion bodies, which were observed on initial pathological findings, clearly indicated the existence of a CMV disease at the patient's admission.
Usually, resolution of symptoms and endoscopic findings is obtained with IV ganciclovir or foscarnet. Combined antiretroviral therapies may also be effective, even without specific treatment of CMV []. However, in the case of perforation, despite immediate surgical resection and antiviral therapy, mortality rate remains elevated (> 80%), due to elevated operative mortality and increased postoperative complications [,]. In our case, ganciclovir therapy successfully reduced CMV viral load before the occurrence of death, which resulted from misdiagnosed gastric perforation."
16,71722,678825,608638,"In September 2001, a previously healthy, Caucasian, 14-year-old boy was admitted to our hospital. Two weeks prior to his arrival, he had developed abdominal pain, a recurring fever of up to 39°C, and an intermittent cough. These symptoms were worsening and his general condition was deteriorating.
On examination he had diffuse abdominal pain located primarily in the upper abdomen, and his temperature was 38.5°C. His skin and the further physical examination was normal. Pertinent laboratory investigations are listed in Table . Of note, the activated partial thromboplastin time and prothrombin time were both prolonged, mild thrombopenia and leukocytosis of 14/nl were present, and C-reactive protein was elevated (6.1 mg/dl). The activity of factors II, V, VII and VIII was normal. There was no history of autoimmune diseases or coagulation disorders in his family.
The initial abdominal ultrasound revealed a tumor in the right pararenal space. However, a clear anatomical relation to the adrenal gland could not be established (Figures 1 and 2- see Additional file and ). The left adrenal gland was slightly enlarged. Doppler ultrasonography showed no thromboses of abdominal vessels and serum cortisol was normal at this stage. The CT scan identified the tumor as hematoma.
Additional tests were positive for lupus anticoagulant and anti-cardiolipin antibodies. Bleeding time was prolonged to 11 minutes but all other coagulation tests eliminated the possibility of acute bleeding. In fact a repeated test of bleeding time a few days later was normal.
Under intravenous treatment with cefuroxim the patient's temperature normalized within two days. But by day five, C-reactive protein increased to 12 mg/dl, and the patient's temperature rose again so antibiotic therapy was extended by gentamycin.
Ten day after being admitted, the boy suddenly suffered generalized tonic-clonic seizures due to severe hyponatremia of 111 mmol/l. Serum transaminases raised to levels five times above normal range, and after three days hemoglobin dropped from 11.8 g/l to 7.6 g/l. Since LDH was elevated and haptoglobin was reduced, we diagnosed hemolytic anemia and transfused him with erythrocyte concentrates.
Two days before the acute onset of adrenal insufficiency, microhematuria began. Proteinuria increased to 1 g/l and β-2-microglobulin raised to 0.16 mg/dl but there were no clinical signs of urinary infection. As the C-reactive protein rose to 16.1 mg/dl, intravenous antibiotic treatment was changed to erythromycin, ceftriaxon, tobramycin and flucloxacillin. However, two blood cultures, urine culture, stool culture and liquor culture remained sterile. Furthermore, serum serological tests were negative for the following infections: borrelia-burgdorferi, HIV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, listeria, leptospira, epstein-barr-virus, treponema pallidum, parvovirus B 19, cytomegalie virus, mycoplasma pneumonia, coxsackivirus type B1-B6, chlamydia pneumonia and toxoplasmosis. Tuberculosis was ruled out by mendel-mantoux skin test, microscopy of Ziehl-Nelson stained urine samples, PCR of a urine and liquor sample, and chest x-ray.
The boy was transferred to the intensive care unit and hyponatremia was balanced within the next 12 h with intravenous application of NaCl 5.85%. Over the course of the next 5 h until his serum sodium was above 125 mmol/l, he had repeated convulsions for up to 30 minutes. Due to status epilepticus and marked agitation, intubation and artificial ventilation was required.
A second CT scan on the next day showed a novel hemorrhage of the left adrenal as well and bleeding in the right pararenal region had enlarged (Figure 3- see ). A CT scan of the head was normal, cortisol was low and the adrenals were unresponsive to the Synacten test. We started treatment with hydrocortisone, fludrocortisone and 10 days later with phenprocoumon.
Under this treatment the boy improved clinically within two days and was extubated. As well, laboratory signs of hepatitis normalized within the next three weeks and hemoglobin remained in normal range after blood transfusion. The C-reactive protein normalized within 10 days and antibiotic treatment was stopped as no other clinical or laboratory signs of infection were present.
We continued to monitor the patients condition. As shown in table , lupus anticoagulant and cardiolipin antibodies remained positive. He did not develop any other autoimmune diseases (Table ). The boy's parents and his brother were negative for lupus anticoagulant and cardiolipin antibodies."
17,71722,476387,494312,"A 49-year-old female with metastatic breast cancer (supraclavicular lymph node metastases) presented with dyspnoea, intermittent coughing and general weakness. The patient had undergone chemotherapy with treosulfane via a totally implantable venous access port catheter the day before.
The venous silicone catheter system (Fresenius Intraport, Fresenius Kabi, Bad Homburg, Germany) had been implanted 2 years before via the left cephalic vein by tangential incision of the vein after distal ligation without intra- or postoperative complications in our department. Correct placement had been documented by x-ray of the chest immediately after the implantation (figure ). Following implantation, the catheter had been used for three months without any problems. Thereafter, the system was regularly flushed with heparin-saline solution. On presentation, injection into the port catheter was freely possible but caused instant reflectory coughing. Aspiration of blood via the port was not possible. Laboratory findings showed a mild leukocytosis of 11.0/nl and hypokalemia of 2.6 mmol/l.
Further radiological diagnostics including injection of contrast medium into the catheter documented a dislocation of the catheter tip into the upper lobe of the right lung with paravasation into the bronchial system (figure ). In addition, thoracic computerised tomographic (CT) scan showed a large pleural effusion in the right pleural cavity (figure ). There was no evidence for mediastinal or intrapulmonal tumour growth or lymph node metastases at the site of perforation. The patient was referred to the department of thoracic surgery for further therapy. The intrapulmonal tip of the port catheter was cut off and extracted thoracoscopically. The remaining catheter retracted into the superior caval vein lumen. As the patient had undergone mammarial gland ablation on both sides with consecutive radiation there was a severe dermatitis with ulcerations at the implantation site of the port catheter. Due to the high-risk of infection and wound healing complications and the limited life-expectancy of the patient, it was decided to leave the injection chamber and catheter remnant in situ without any further use for injections or infusions. The patient recovered from the intervention without complications."
18,79711,365995,50046,"A 25-year old female presented to the emergency department with a one week history of low grade fever, increasing cough and dyspnea on exertion. At presentation she had dyspnea at rest, orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. Around two and a half months before the present illness, she had low grade fever, anorexia and weight loss, cough with expectoration and hemoptysis. She was investigated at another center and a sputum smear for acid-fast bacilli was positive. She was started on antituberculous therapy with which she improved symptomatically. She experienced weight gain, and her appetite became normal. A sputum smear performed after two months for acid-fast bacilli was negative. On examination, the patient was conscious and afebrile with a pulse rate of 128 beats/minute, blood pressure of 100/60 mm Hg and a respiratory rate of 38/minute. She had bilateral pitting pedal edema. Examination of the cardiovascular system revealed tachycardia, elevated jugular venous pressure, diffuse apical impulse and left ventricular third heart sound. Auscultation of the chest showed bibasal inspiratory crackles. She also had tender hepatomegaly and free fluid in the abdomen. Her oxygen saturation was 85% on pulse oximetry. Arterial blood gases showed type 1 respiratory failure [(FiO2 0.5) – pH 7.48, PaO2 8.2 kPa, PaCO2 3.6 kPa, HCO3 21 mEq/L]. She was started on supplemental oxygen, intravenous morphine, nitroglycerin, furosemide and dobutamine, oral captopril, stress ulcer and deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis. Chest X-ray (Figure ) done two months ago showed right upper lobe consolidation with normal cardiac silhouette. A chest radiograph (Figure ) performed at admission revealed cardiomegaly and bilateral alveolar opacities. Electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia and non-specific ST-T changes in the lateral leads. Echocardiography was performed which revealed global hypokinesia, enlarged left atrium and left ventricle, mild mitral regurgitation, severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of 20%; left ventricular end systolic and end diastolic dimensions were 45 and 51 mm respectively. Right atrium and right ventricle were dilated with associated mild tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 47 mm Hg. A provisional diagnosis of viral myocarditis was made and she was shifted to respiratory intensive care unit where noninvasive ventilation (NIV) was initiated with continuous positive airway pressure at 10 cm H2O. Arterial line was placed through the right radial artery and continuous electrocardiographic monitoring was performed. As the patient had no improvement with NIV and was becoming hypoxemic and agitated, she was given intravenous fentanyl and oral endotracheal intubation was performed. She was mechanically ventilated with assist/control mode at tidal volumes of 350 mL, rate of 20, PEEP of 10 cm H2O, and FiO2 of 1. Her peak and plateau pressures were 35 and 28 cm H2O respectively. She was sedated intermittently with intravenous fentanyl. Blood cultures, mycoplasma and legionella serology were sent and patient was also started on intravenous azithromycin. Other treatment measures and antituberculous therapy were continued. Biochemical investigations revealed hypoalbuminemia and prerenal azotemia; liver function tests, complete blood, coagulation profile and urinalysis were normal. With mechanical ventilation, oxygen saturation improved and oxygen requirements decreased to 0.4. She had recurrent episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and amiodarone infusion was started. However on the second day of admission she had a sudden episode of ventricular fibrillation and despite all resuscitative measures the patient could not be revived. Her husband did not give consent for an autopsy; however he agreed for a post-mortem cardiac biopsy, which revealed multi-focal areas of caseous myocardial necrosis, Ziehl-Neelson stain for acid-fast bacilli was positive (Figure ). HIV serology received postmortem was nonreactive."
19,79711,958097,715566,"This 49-year-old male patient with Anderson-Fabry disease was referred to our hospital. He did not complain of anginal symptoms or dyspnea. As a part of an overall clinical evaluation, transthoracic echocardiography was performed, revealing a diffusely distributed myocardial hypertrophy, i.e. involving both (LV) free walls and the septum (the myocardial thickness at diastole was measured in the short parasternal-axis: the anterior segment of the septum- 19.6 mm; the posterior segment of the septum – 20.8 mm; the LV posterior wall – 20.7 mm; and the anterolateral wall 16.8 mm). Left ventricular systolic function was preserved (LV ejection fraction 68%). A precise assessment of myocardial hypertrophy by magnetic resonance imaging confirmed increased LV mass to 386 grams."
20,87870,341323,294247,"A 51-year-old female presented with history of acute right upper abdominal pain, localised abdominal signs and raised inflammatory markers. Ultrasound scanning suggested acute cholecystitis. The patient was explored initially by laparoscopy but converted to an open operation at the referring hospital. An irresectable mass, which was thought to be an advanced gallbladder carcinoma, was found. Several needle biopsies were taken from the tumour but the gallbladder was not excised. Histology of the biopsies showed features of IMT of the gallbladder. She developed obstructive jaundice postoperatively, ERCP showed a distal bile duct stricture which was stented. CT scan showed a mass lesion in the gallbladder area with direct involvement of the liver and no metastatic disease elsewhere (Figure ). In view of the histological diagnosis the patient underwent re-laparotomy through an extended subcostal incision. Operative findings included a tense, distended gallbladder containing stones, debris and pus with a segment of transverse colon densely adherent to the mass. An en-bloc cholecystectomy and limited transverse colectomy with primary anastomosis was performed. The mass was peeled off the first and second part of duodenum, common bile duct and transverse mesocolon. Intra-operative cholangiogram via the cystic duct stump showed no biliary leakage and the dye flowed freely into the duodenum with the biliary stent in situ.
On pathological examination, the tumour measured 12 cms. Microscopy of the resected mass showed the gallbladder wall to be replaced by proliferative spindle myofibroblastic cells arranged in fascicles, admixed with diffuse chronic inflammatory cells including lymphocytes, plasma cells and eosinophils with lymphoid aggregates. In places hyalinised fibrous stroma was seen. No pleomorphism or vascular invasion was evident. Mitoses were inconspicuous (Figure ). The mass was seen to grow in an infiltrating pattern with entrapment of adipocytes and extending to the muscularis propria of colon from externally. The tumour extended to the resection margin. Four lymph nodes showed reactive changes. Immunhistochemistry showed positivity for SMA (Figure ) and calponin. ALK-1 was equivocal. However desmin, caldesmon and CAM 5.2 were negative (Figure ).
The postoperative period was uneventful. ERCP was done at four weeks after operation with replacement of the stent because of slight stricturing of the common hepatic duct. No local recurrence was detected at six months follow-up on CT scan."
21,87870,653319,674740,"In July 1998, a 30-year old man with morbid obesity [weight 340 pounds] presented to emergency department with 3-weeks history of 'flu-like' symptoms with fever, chills, night sweats and cough with yellowish phlegm that started after building a dock at his cottage. Chest x-ray revealed bibasilar infiltrates. He was admitted with bilateral pneumonia and was started on intravenous penicillin and oral clarithromycin after obtaining blood and sputum cultures. Three days later he developed rash and penicillin was discontinued and antibiotics were changed to intravenous ceftriaxone and erythromycin. He remained febrile for next 7 days. Sputum Gram stain showed many pus cells but cultures remained negative. His condition continued to deteriorate. Local bronchoscopist was unavailable to perform bronchoscopy and arrangements were made to transfer him to another hospital. Before transfer, his condition deteriorated and was intubated. Tracheal secretions were aspirated and sent for cultures – including fungal and tubercular. The night of transfer, he developed cardio-respiratory arrest and couldn't be resuscitated. Next day, the wet preparation on the tracheal secretions revealed thick walled budding yeast consistent with blastomycosis. Autopsy showed severe pulmonary disease with solidification of both lungs and cultures confirmed the diagnosis."
22,124373,787715,545734,"In July 2000, a 34-year old obese woman [270 pounds] presented to the emergency department with pleuritic chest pain associated with chills and night sweats about a week after she was camping at the lakeside cottage. She denied symptoms of cough or phlegm. She was diagnosed with musculoskeletal pain and discharged home on analgesics. Five days later she presented with ongoing symptoms of fever, chills with dry cough and right lower chest pain. A chest X-ray revealed an infiltrate in the right lower lobe. She was diagnosed with community acquired right lower lobe pneumonia and sent home on oral clarithromycin. She presented 4-days later with ongoing symptoms to the emergency department and the chest x-ray now showed worsening pneumonia. She was admitted to the hospital and started on intravenous ampicillin and ceftriaxone, and a ventilation-perfusion scan showed a matched perfusion defect in right lower lobe. She continued to feel weak with night sweats and chest X-ray showed worsening of infiltrate. A medical consult was requested. At this time, during consultation it was noted that her symptoms started after a short stay at the cottage that reminded me of the previous case, and the possibility of acute blastomycosis pneumonia was raised. Her white blood cell count remained slightly elevated at 13.0 but erythrocyte sedimentation rate was markedly elevated at 112. As she didn't have productive cough, a bronchoscopy was recommended that couldn't be performed locally [local bronchoscopist was away] and she was referred to a tertiary care center where bronchio-aleveolar lavage showed budding yeast and cultures confirmed growth of blastomycosis. She was treated initially with intravenous amphotericin B and later switched to oral itraconazole for a year and made full recovery."
23,124373,488802,745943,"In July of 2002, a 36-year old obese woman [weight 200 pounds, height 5 feet 1 inch] with history of type 2 diabetes for 5 years, presented to the emergency department with 5 days history of fever, chills and cough with yellowish phlegm and sharp pain in her right lower chest that aggravated with deep breathing. Physical examination was unremarkable. She was afebrile and lungs were clear. Homen's sign was negative. Initial laboratory data showed slightly elevated d-dimer of 0.374 ug/mL [normal <0.25 ug/mL]. A chest X-ray (figure ) showed right lower lobe infiltrate. She was diagnosed with community acquired pneumonia and sent home on oral clarithromycin 500 mg BID, cefurox 500 mg BID for 7 days and acetaminophen as required.
She continued to have symptoms of fever, chills, night sweats with productive cough and dyspnea and presented to the hospital five days later. She denied hemoptysis. Physical examination revealed a temperature of 39 degree Celsius, mild tachycardia with heart rate of 104 beats per minute, normal blood pressure of 125/74 mmHg and respiratory rate of 18. Pulse oxymetry revealed oxygen saturation of 96% on room air. There was decreased air entry with bronchial breath sounds in right lower chest. A white cell count was slightly elevated at 13.5, with normal hemoglobin of 128 g/L and d-dimer between 0.25–0.50 ug/mL. A second chest X-ray (figure ) showed dense infiltrate in right lower lobe. She was admitted with the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia and started on intravenous levofloxacin 500 mg a day.
She had a positive Mantoux test in 1976. There was no history of travel save for visiting her sister's cottage at the local lake a weak before where she slept at the gazebo for two nights. There were no pets at home. She smoked one pack per day and entertained social drinks.
She continued to have temperature up to 39 degrees Celsius, productive cough and shortness of breath. Sputum Gram stain showed 4+ neutrophils and 1+ normal flora and blood cultures remained negative. She received intravenous levofloxacin and clindamycin for one week. Bronchoscopy performed on day 6 was unremarkable save for inflammatory changes in lower lungs and samples were collected for bacterial and tuberculosis cultures [in retrospect, the specimen was not sent for fungal cultures]. On 7th day because of ongoing symptoms, the antibiotics were changed to intravenous imipenem-cilastatin sodium 1 gm every 12 hour and she has had a CT scan of chest (figure ) that showed bibasilar consolidation with sparing of the apices. The white cell count fluctuated between 13.6 to 20.2 [normal 4.0–11.0 × 109 /L]. Hemoglobin decreased to 97 g/L. BUN, serum creatinine, electrolytes, AST, ALT, GGT and ALP were normal. Urinalysis was negative. Blood, urine and sputum cultures remained negative. Sputum gram stain showed 3-4+ neutrophils without organisms. ESR on day 8 was elevated at 112 mm/hr [normal 0–15]. Antinuclear antibody was negative. Arterial blood gas on day 8 showed pH of 7.46, pCO2 of 35, pO2 of 59 and oxygen saturation of 91% on room air. She was started on supplemental oxygen by nasal prongs. Bronchoscopic specimen cultures were negative save for pending TB cultures.
After five days of intravenous imipenem-cilastatin sodium therapy, there was no improvement in her clinical condition. Another medical consult was requested, when the author got involved in her care. She had a temperature of 39 C, pulse rate of 104 and blood pressure of 114/70 mmHg. There was no lymphadenopathy and heart sounds were normal. Her chest examination showed decreased breath sounds at both bases with egophony in right lower chest. There were no pleural rubs. There was no clubbing or cyanosis. The rest of the examination was unremarkable save for an obese benign abdomen.
Chest X-ray (figure ) now showed further deterioration of the bilateral infiltrates with nodular appearance and the radiologist remarked, ""The lesions are suspicious of metastases."" Sputum cytology showed a large number of acute inflammatory cells without malignant cells. The possibility of vasculitis was entertained because of markedly elevated ESR and antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) was negative.
The history of sleeping at the cottage for two nights, a week before her illness started; progressive bilateral pneumonia with ongoing high-grade fever, chills, and night sweats despite sufficient antibiotic coverage and sputum Gram stain showing a large number of neutrophils without organisms (culture negative) raised the author's suspicion for the possibility of fungal process such as acute blastomycosis pneumonia and the Public Health Laboratory (PHL) was specifically asked to perform wet preparation for blastomycosis on the sputum. The PHL laboratory confirmed the presence of 'round thick walled budding yeast like cells (figure ) suggestive of Blastomyces dermatitidis and this was confirmed on fungal cultures. She was promptly started on intravenous amphotericin B and responded well and later switched to oral itraconazole 400 mg twice a day for 6 months and then 200 mg a day for another 6 months. She recovered fully."
24,128405,362899,816983,"Same July of 2002, while case #3 was still-in hospital, a 42-year old man [weight 230 pounds] presented to a peripheral community hospital with symptoms of fever, chills and malaise about 7–10 days after a trip to the local beach. He was diagnosed with community acquired left lower lobe pneumonia and treated with three different kind of antibiotics. He remained febrile with temperature of 39–40 degree Celsius and 10-days after his admission, he was transferred to our hospital and again the past experience and a recent case of similar nature, although from a different region, reminded of the similar process and he underwent bronchoscopy and the wet preparation showed budding yeast and cultures were confirmatory. He was promptly started on intravenous amphotericin B and later switched to oral itraconazole and made full recovery."
25,128405,372054,942395,"In February of 2004, a 57-year old woman with morbid obesity [weight over 350 pounds] with history of hypertension and type 2 diabetes presented with one month history of fever, night sweats and cough and was admitted to the hospital with right sided community acquired pneumonia [figure ] and started on intravenous levaquin. She had history of gall stones and had mild upper abdominal pain. Next morning, while undergoing an ultrasound examination she became unresponsive and suffered cardio-respiratory arrest. She was successfully resuscitated, but remained hypotensive and required inotropic support and admitted to intensive care unit under my care. Because of shock and dense lobar pneumonia, the possibility of severe pneumococcal pneumonia was entertained and intravenous penicillin was added. She had copious amount of thick pus from the endotracheal tube and because of thick pus, possibility of acute blastomycosis pneumonia was entertained although it was -36 degree Celsius outside, and specimen was sent to Public Health Laboratory to perform a wet preparation to confirm or rule out the possibility blastomycosis. Although blastomycosis was suspected but empiric therapy with amphotericin B was not started, as there was no clear cut history of exposure and she presented in the middle of winters when the outside temperature was -30 to -40 degrees Celsius. She was difficult to ventilate and remained unstable during the night. Next morning she arrested and could not be resuscitated after 2-hours of resuscitation. At noon on that day, Public Health Laboratory confirmed the diagnosis of acute blastomycosis pneumonia."
26,146681,37115,59395,"A 55 year old man with idiopathic refractory anaemia was addressed to our Unit for the cure of a recently appeared 3.3 cm hypervascular liver nodule in segment II (November, 2003). Physical examination was normal, including BMI. Liver function tests were as follows: ASAT = 53 IU/L (Normal = 40); ALAT = 58 IU/L (N = 50); Billirubin = 44 μmol/L (N = 17); PT = 70% (N = 70–100); V = 65% (N = 70–100); RBC = 2.9 × 106 cells/μl; Ht = 22.5% and Hb = 7.3 gm/dl; WBC = 4.6 × 103 cells/μl; and platelets = 210 × 109 /l. Ferritinemia was 1891 ng/l (N < 300), transferrin saturation was 100% (N < 40), iron concentration was 290 μmol/g (assessed by MRI, N < 36). AFP in blood was within the normal range. The patient, of Italian origin, was C282 Y -/-, H63D +/-, and S65C -/-, with no family history of iron overload. Markers for viral and autoimmune diseases were negative. Blood glucose was normal. He used to smoke 30 cigarettes per day; but had stopped for the last 8 years. He drank alcohol only occasionally. The treatment of his refractory anaemia consisted in blood transfusion (total of 10 packs), Desferoxamine, and Deferiprone.
Ultrasound examination showed a hypoechogenic ovoid nodule (3.2 × 1.9 cm) in segment II. MRI showed a hypointense non-tumoral liver on T1- and T2-weighted images due to iron overload. In comparison, the nodule was hyperintense on T1- and T2-weighted images. After gadolinium injection, the nodule was hyperintense on T1-weigthed images and remained so in the portal phase (Fig. ).
On December 2003, a left lobe hepatectomy was performed laparoscopically. Follow-up was uneventful. The resected specimen was carefully sliced but no nodule was found on the fresh specimen, and in the expected area. However, after formalin fixation, a 2 cm in diameter paler area was identified (Fig. , arrow). All slices were routinely processed. The following stainings were performed: H&E, trichrome, Perls, reticulin, PAS, and several immunostains (CD34, cytokeratins 7 and 19, CRBP1 and α-SMA; the latter for identification of quiescent and/or activated hepatic stellate cells []). The liver was fibrotic (METAVIR score F3) (Figs. , ) with an iron overload 3 + (according to Searle score), mainly in hepatocytes of zones 1 and 2 (Fig. ). Liver iron concentration was 286 μmol/g (n < 36), and the iron concentration / age ratio was 5.1. Small foci of clear cells devoid of iron were also observed (not shown).
The paler zone, poorly limited from the adjacent parenchyma, was strikingly different. The architecture was preserved but the area was far less fibrotic (METAVIR score F1; Figs. , ), with less iron (Fig. ), less glycogen (Fig. ), and with foci of clear hepatocytes (Figs. , ). In these clear areas, hepatocytes were slightly bigger and occasionally displayed in two cell-thick plates. In these areas, as elsewhere, reticulin network, as well as Ki-67 (Mib-1) and CD34 were normal (not shown). One of the most striking findings was the presence of different types of portal tracts: some were normal (Fig. ), whereas others contained mainly ductules (Fig. ) and others arteries (Fig. ). Regarding the number of CRBP1 and α-SMA positive cells, no obvious differences were seen between the fibrotic and non-fibrotic parts of the liver. CRBP 1 positive cells seemed to contain few lipid droplets."
27,146681,635063,762144,"A previously well 21 year old East Timorese male presented to his local medical officer with a 2 month history of right elbow pain, associated with swelling and progressive limitation of movement. He also reported a 6 kg loss of weight during this time, but denied any other constitutional symptoms.
He appeared well, was afebrile, and had no abnormality on chest or abdominal examination. Examination of the right elbow revealed a firm, tender swelling, approximately 2 cm in diameter, over the lateral humeral epicondyle, with associated limitation of elbow flexion to 60 degrees.
Initial investigation with plain XR of the right elbow joint revealed a joint effusion (Figure ). As these findings were non-specific, further evaluation with different imaging modalities was undertaken.
Ultrasound examination of the elbow showed a large joint effusion (Figure ). Scintigraphic imaging with Tc99m three phase bone scanning demonstrated increased blood pool activity, and diffusely increased osteoblastic activity, involving the right elbow joint, particularly the distal humerus and ulna, as well as the distal left radius (Figure ).
CT scan confirmed the presence of cortical erosions involving the right lateral epicondyle of the humerus and the ulna. Further, there was increased attenuation within the proximal medullary shaft of the ulna, and diffuse soft tissue thickening around the proximal ulna and radial head, with an associated joint effusion (Figure ).
Further functional imaging with Thallium 201 chloride revealed intense early uptake in the right lateral epicondyle of the humerus and proximal ulna (Figure ). The delayed 4 hour images demonstrated tracer retention (Figure ). The delayed whole body views showed further abnormal thallium retention involving the mediastinum, para-aortic regions of the abdomen, the left inguinal region and the distal left radius (Figure ).
MR demonstrated erosive changes involving the lateral epicondyle, a loculated joint effusion and thickening and enhancement of the joint capsule and the annular ligament of the superior radio-ulnar joint. These changes suggested either a neoplasm or possibly infection (Figure ).
The patient was therefore referred to the Bone and Soft Tissue Sarcoma service for further investigation.
Biopsy of the right elbow joint demonstrated chronic synovial inflammation and numerous polymorphonuclear cells in the synovial fluid, but no malignant cells (Figure ). Microbiological examination, including staining for acid-fast bacilli and fungi, revealed no organisms.
CT scanning of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, performed in light of the thallium findings, revealed extensive retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. The lymphadenopathy was characterised by peripheral enhancement with prominent central areas of low attenuation (Figures and ).
Subsequent CT guided biopsy of the retroperitoneal lymphoid tissue revealed necrotising granulomatous lymphadenitis indicative of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection (Figure ). While no acid fast bacilli were visible on Ziehl-Nielsen staining, polymerase chain reaction was positive for M. tuberculosis DNA. The lymph node biopsy specimens cultured M. tuberculosis after 6 weeks.
A final diagnosis of disseminated extrapulmonary tuberculosis was therefore made. Anti tuberculous therapy was commenced with good clinical response."
28,161867,775655,913819,"A 19-year-old male, semi-elite Australian Rules footballer presented with left sided hamstring pain that occurred during a game two weeks prior. The patient had not played a game or been able to train for two weeks since the injury. He had been treated with cryotherapy, NSAID's, slump stretching, lumbar spine mobilizations, ultrasound and massage to the hamstrings. He had a history of mild osteitis pubis 12 months previously that was treated with rest and modified activity. There had been no prior history of hamstring or low back injury.
On physical examination the patient was standing with an apparent lumbar spine hyperlordosis, anterior pelvis tilt, flexed knees and increased thoracic kyphosis. There was tight (reduced range of motion) bilateral hip flexors (modified Thomas position* +15°) and hamstring muscles (45° straight leg raise [SLR]), hypertonicity of the gluteii, hamstring, lumbar and psoas muscles and general mid thoracic and lumbar spine motion restriction, determined by inter-segmental motion palpation and observation of range of motion (ROM). (*Modified Thomas testing requires the patient to sit at the edge of the table and to bring one knee to their chest to firmly flatten their back. They then assume the supine position, allowing the testing leg to extend off the table. An angle is formed between the femur and a line drawn parallel to the tabletop. A positive angle means the femur is projecting upwards. A negative angle means the femur hangs downwards). There was weakness of the left hamstring and gluteus maximus graded 4/5. Hamstring tenderness could not be localized on palpation. Other physical examination findings, including Trendelenburg, valsalva, neurological, slump, extension leg raise and hip and sacroiliac joint motion palpation and orthopedic testing were unremarkable. The patient was given a working diagnosis of back-related hamstring injury as a result of lumbar-pelvic myofascial pain referral, mimicking a grade one hamstring strain. Differential diagnoses included pain referral from gluteal trigger points.
Treatment involved long-lever SMT to the lumbar spine, short-lever SMT to the mid thoracic spine, drop piece knee manipulation, active release soft tissue massage techniques (ART) to the psoas, gluteal, lumbar and hamstring muscles and proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) stretching of the hamstring and psoas muscles. Post treatment, modified Thomas position bilaterally was +5°, SLR 60° bilaterally and muscle strength was graded 5/5.
The patient received 3 treatment sessions that week and played a match the next week without re-injury. He was put on a maintenance program for the rest of the 12 weeks of the season including finals (one visit per week for a month, one visit per fortnight thereafter) which included the above treatment and strengthening and muscle activation work (to improve hip extension and abduction motor patterns) to the gluteus maximus and medius, multifidus, transversus abdominus and internal oblique muscles. Maximum medical improvement (MMI) was reached after 7 treatments. The patient finished the season without re-injury. Posture and muscle length changes continued to improve over this period (bilateral modified Thomas position -5°, SLR 85°)."
29,161867,519179,277173,"A 25 year old male, semi-elite Australian Rules footballer felt a 'twinge' in his right hamstring during a game. He presented to us the day after, complaining of tightness in his medial right hamstring and a stiff low back. He had no previous history of hamstring injury but had suffered episodic low back pain over a 5-year period.
On physical examination, the right pelvis was low compared to the left in standing position; there were tight right (45° SLR) and left (55° SLR) hamstrings and tight left hip flexors (+10° modified Thomas position). There was palpable hypertonicity through the right hamstring, left psoas, lumbar and gluteal muscles, thoracolumbar spine and right sacro-iliac joint (SIJ) motion restriction, positive Gillett's (standing S-I joint motion palpation) and extension leg raise testing for the right SIJ and weakness of the right hamstring and gluteus maximus muscles rated 4/5. Hamstring tenderness could not be localized on palpation but mild discomfort was reproduced in resisted muscle testing. Other physical examination findings and testing procedures, including Trendelenburg, valsalva, neurological, slump, lumbar ROM and hip joint motion palpation and orthopedic testing were unremarkable. The patient was diagnosed with a back-related hamstring injury on the basis of his apparent right SIJ motion restriction and pain referral. Differential diagnoses included pain referral from lumbar-pelvic myofascial structures, gluteal trigger points or a grade 1 hamstring injury with concurrent lumbar-pelvic dysfunction.
Treatment involved high velocity low amplitude (HVLA) SMT to the right SIJ and thoracolumbar spine, long axis manipulation to the right hip joint, ART to the right hamstring, left psoas, lumbar and gluteal muscles, PNF stretching of the right hamstring and left psoas and hamstring cryotherapy. Post treatment, modified Thomas position was 0° on the left, SLR 55° on the right and 65° on the left. Muscle strength was graded 5/5.
The patient did not participate in training during the week and received 2 more treatment sessions. He played a match the next weekend without re-injury. He was seen twice the next week and put on a maintenance program for the 16 weeks remaining in the season (one visit per week for a month, one visit per fortnight for a month, one visit per month thereafter). This included the above treatment plus strengthening and muscle activation work (to improve hip extension motor patterns and running technique) to the gluteus maximus, multifidus, transversus abdominus and internal oblique muscles and home advice including flexibility and stability work. MMI was reached after 10 treatments. No re-injury occurred during this period and muscle length changes continued to improve (bilateral modified Thomas position 0°, SLR 75°)."
30,172573,900289,226288,"In January 2004 previously healthy 38-year-old man was admitted to hospital with fever (40°C) and arthralgia of upper and lower extremities. He was not addicted to drugs or alcohol. He smoked about 20 cigarettes per day. Physical examination revealed mild tachycardia with normal cardiac sounds and normal blood pressure. Oral cavity examination showed poor dentition. He presented generalized arthralgia and edema and redness of involved joints. Also there was a 3 day history of papulomacular haemorrhagic rash on his lower extremities. The patient had no symptoms of respiratory tract infection and X-ray examination showed no evidence of pneumonia. Laboratory evaluation revealed elevated white blood cell count (17,8 × 103/μl) with 34% of band neutrophils and 51% of granulocytes, decreased platelet count (29 × 103/μl), slightly elevated liver enzymes (AST 52 U/L, ALT 41 U/L, LDH 589 U/L, alkaline phosphate 150 U/L), hyperbilirubinemia (2,69 mg%), elevetad creatinine concentration (1,51 mg%), mild proteinuria, leucocyturia and erythrocyturia. The initial diagnosis was septicemia. Three blood samples were drawn during two first days of hospitalization for microbiological evaluation and empirical therapy with ceftazidime and teicoplanin was started.
Nontoxigenic C. diphtheriae biotype gravis was isolated from all blood cultures. On the third day of treatment the antibiotics were changed to amikacin and ciprofloxacin according to antibiogram. Despite resolution of most symptoms and negative blood and throat swab cultures after eight days of treatment the patient was still febrile. For that reason ciprofloxacin was changed to clindamycin.
Transthoracic and transoesopharyngeal echocardiography performed on the 13th day of treatment showed two vegetations attached to the mitral and aortal valves. The patient underwent surgery for replacement of both valves. The cultures from vegetations were negative. After the operation the patient recovered. Although the cultures were negative we have supposed that the vegetations were caused by C. diphtheriae because the patient had no cardiac troubles before bacteremia.
Nontoxigenic C. diphtheriae biotype gravis isolated from blood cultures was identified and biotyped with use of morphological and biochemical methods as described elsewhere. Toxin production was examined in vitro by the conventional [] and modified Elek test []. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used for the detection of diphtheria toxin gene [,] and the PCR result was negative.
The susceptibility of isolates to 13 antibiotics was determined by the disk diffusion method accordingly to the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards [] guidelines on Mueller-Hinton II blood agar (supplemented with 5% sheep blood). However NCCLS does not define breakpoints for Corynebacterium sp. For that reason interpretation was done comparatively as for Streptococcus spp. and Staphylococcus spp., because some breakpoints are different for that genera. The antimicrobial disks contained penicillin, cefaclor, cefuroxime axetil, cefazolin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefepime, amikacin, meropenem, azithromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, vancomycin and teicoplanin. Determination of MIC (results are shown in brackets) for ampicillin (0.5 mg/L), gentamicin (0.38 mg/L), ciprofloxacin (0.125 mg/L), clindamycin (0.25 mg/L), erythromycin (0.016 mg/L), chloramphenicol (2 mg/L) and tetracycline (0.5 mg/L) was done using E-test strips. Clindamycin and erythromycin MIC breakpoints for Streptococcus spp. are lower than for Staphylococcus spp. but both interpretations showed susceptibility of examined C. diphtheriae strain. Ampicillin MIC breakpoints pointed to investigated strain as ampicillin resistant. The strain was also resistant to penicillin and ceftazidime and intermediate to cefuroxime axetil and ceftriaxone."
31,172573,108607,509456,"On December 22, 2001, an 18-year-old male in his eighth week of Marine Corps basic training presented to the field medical station with headache and an episode of vomiting after physical training.
His neurological symptoms progressed over the next several hours until he became disoriented and unresponsive. He was evaluated in the local hospital emergency department where a fever of 39.1C (102.5F) and disorientation to person, place, and time were observed. Lumbar puncture performed during medical evaluation revealed an opening pressure greater than 500 mm; cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was milky white, with a glucose concentration of 3 mg/dl and total protein of 269 mg/dl. White count in the CSF was 4444 with 91% segmented neutrophils, and microscopic evaluation of the CSF revealed Gram-positive diplococci. A presumptive diagnosis of pneumococcal meningitis was made; intravenous ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and vancomycin were initiated. Despite these measures, the patient's condition remained unimproved. He was transferred to the intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital on ventilator support. Intravenous dexamethasone was initiated; antibiotics and supportive care were continued. He died approximately 30 hours after his initial presentation to the field medical station.
The patient had no previous history of meningitis, neurologic abnormalities or other medical problems. Prior to onset of his illness, there was no history of head trauma, and he was taking no medications. He received a meningococcal vaccination (Menomune A/C/Y/W135, Aventis Pasteur) on October 31, 2001. He had no history of receiving pneumococcal vaccination.
Blood and CSF cultures were positive for Streptococcus pneumoniae, sensitive to all antibiotics tested. Streptococcal culture of the throat was negative.
A pneumococcal isolate from the blood was sent to the Respiratory Disease Laboratory at NHRC for additional evaluation. Serotyping was performed using a modified version of the latex agglutination typing method []. Samples were tested against antisera for vaccine-covered serotypes (Statens Serum Institut, Denmark) and results confirmed using the classic Quellung reaction and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) technique.
For MLST, chromosomal DNA was extracted using spin DNA extraction columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). A subsequent PCR reaction was carried out in 100-μl volumes, using primer pairs developed by Enright and Spratt []. Each of the primer pairs amplify an internal fragment of 7 housekeeping genes: aroE, gdh, gki, recP, spi, xpt, and ddl. Amplified DNA fragments were purified using QIAquick purification columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and directly sequenced in each direction on an automated sequencer with Big Dye terminator chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Allelic matches at each loci were determined through a search engine at the pneumococcal MLST Web site .
Using the classic serotyping methods outlined, the isolate did not react with any of the 23-valent vaccine-specific typing antisera. Molecular investigation utilizing MLST demonstrated an allelic profile that matched sequence type 393. Using the MLST database, this sequence type matched a likely pneumococcal serotype 38 (PS38). The latex agglutination was repeated using antisera against this serotype, and results were confirmatory.
PS38 is not covered by the current 23-valent polysaccharide or the 7-valent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine formulations, which include pneumococcal serotypes that are considered the most common causes of invasive and antibiotic-resistant infections in the US. Given the fatal outcome in this case and the importance of vaccine formulations being appropriately targeted, the medical literature was explored to evaluate pneumococcal disease caused by PS38 in the US and outside the US. Particular emphasis was placed on temporal trends and documented cases of meningitis caused by this serotype.
Within the US, relatively few cases of PS38 disease have been reported. A few reported PS38 carriage isolates were found (3/235, 1.3%) from Alabama 1975 to 1978, but no cases of PS38 were among the 105 invasive isolates tested []. From 1985 to 1989 in Alabama, no PS38 was noted among 303 cases of meningitis or bacteremia, and only 2 cases were found among 228 cases of otitis media []. Black and colleagues reported two cases of invasive PS38 disease in children attending clinics in northern California from October 1995 to August 1998 []. A comprehensive analysis of pneumococcal isolates recovered from patients with invasive disease in the US in 1999 was performed by Gertz and colleagues. Among 1,168 isolates examined, only 5 were identified as PS38 (0.4%) []. More recently, three of 185 (1.6%) invasive isolates, and only 8/1379 (0.6%) carriage isolates were found to be PS38 among isolates from Alaska, 1998 to 2002 []. Given the invasive:carriage ratio of this and other analyzed studies, this report concluded that although the invasive potential of PS38 was similar to other vaccine serotypes, the carriage was so low that the significance of serious infections caused by PS38 was minimal at that time. Although not specified, meningitis was likely among these few documented invasive illnesses caused by PS38 within the US.
In a large review of the Active Bacterial Core Surveillance (ABCs) performed by Robinson and colleagues from 1995 to 1998, serotype 38 was not mentioned among the top 14 serotypes []. Likewise, numerous other studies failed to reveal PS38 among the reported contributing serotypes [,].
Cases of invasive PS38 disease have been reported in Australia, Spain, England, and Canada in recent years [-]. One Australian study identified 7 (12.4%) cases of invasive PS38 disease in non-indigenous adolescents, making PS38 the second most common non-vaccine covered serotype identified in this population []. Of particular interest is the study of pneumococcal isolates causing local and invasive disease in Spain from January 1997 to June 2001. Unlike the previous studies, a strain of PS38 was identified that was resistant to penicillin (MIC > 0.06 mg/L) [].
In addition to causing invasive pneumococcal infections, PS38 has been found in isolates from children with acute otitis media in the Czech Republic [] and from nasopharyngeal swabs in a study of pneumococcal carriage in Canadian children attending daycare from 1995 to 1996 []. In the study of pneumococcal carriage, PS38 ranked the 14th most common serotype, with 8 out of 589 (1.36%) isolates positive for PS38.
In contrast to these small studies with recognized PS38 disease or carriage, numerous other comprehensive reports from outside the US failed to demonstrate a burden. A review of over 70 global data sets performed by Hausdorff and colleagues failed to reveal PS38 among the top 25 serotypes identified among children; however, PS38 did rank #23 out of the top 24 isolates identified from adults []. In a paired report, Hausdorff did not assign significance to PS38 as he evaluated the disease manifestations of the top 16 global pneumococcal serotypes []. Likewise, in subsequent studies, PS38 was not mentioned among isolates of importance for otitis media or for invasive disease in the literature outside the US [,,]. More recently, among invasive isolates considered: 150 from studies in Oxford, England, 1995–2001 []; 92 from Iceland, 1992–2001 []; 69 from Toronto, 1995 []; 112 from Kenya, 1992–1996 [], and 56 from Papau New Guinea, 1981–1987 [], PS38 was again not among the serotypes identified.
Among reports of studies outside the US that specifically address meningitis cases caused by PS38, Table summarizes reports from Africa, Asia, Europe, and South America from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s. The prevalence of PS38-associated meningitis ranged from 0.2% in South Africa to 5.6% in Southern India. Of the cases with reported antibiotic sensitivities, all were penicillin-susceptible [,]. In four of the five reports, PS38 meningitis was among the 23 most common serotypes reported [-].
Of the PS38 disease reported outside the US, invasive pneumococcal disease was not uncommon. Additionally, even though most PS38 isolates tested were pan-sensitive to broad-spectrum antibiotics, antibiotics can be ineffective in a rapidly fulminating infection. This suggests considering primary measures such as vaccination for PS38 disease prevention. In some countries, PS38 was implicated in enough cases of invasive disease to be considered for inclusion into a 14- or 23-valent vaccine formulated for that region [-]. Although PS38 seems to be a sporadic cause of pneumococcal disease worldwide, temporal trends of increasing incidence were not appreciated."
32,202319,40119,893237,"A 59 year-old male with Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy presented with visually limiting pseudophakic corneal edema in his right eye with a best-corrected visual acuity of 20/50. Cataract extraction had been performed two years previously in the right eye through a 3.2 mm limbal incision. An uncomplicated penetrating keratoplasty was performed, with an 8.25 mm donor cornea secured into an 8 mm recipient opening with 16 interrupted 10-0 nylon sutures. On the first postoperative day, the graft demonstrated diffuse 3+–4+ stromal edema and a nearly complete epithelial defect. The anterior chamber was deep, and no aqueous leakage was noted from either the wound or suture tracks. The epithelial defect resolved in the first postoperative week, although 1+–2+ stromal edema persisted. As the graft remained edematous 4 weeks later, the patient was diagnosed with PGF, and a repeat penetrating keratoplasty was performed 5 weeks after the primary graft. Three years later, the second graft remains clear, with a central pachymetry of 495 μm, and corrected visual acuity of 20/25+.
The host corneal button removed at the initial penetrating keratoplasty and the failed donor corneal button were formalin-fixed and analyzed with light microscopy after staining with hematoxylin and eosin, periodic acid-Schiff, and Masson trichrome stains. Histopathologic examination of the host corneal button revealed stromal edema, thickening and excrescences of Descemet's membrane, and a decreased number of endothelial cells, consistent with Fuchs' corneal dystrophy. Histopathologic examination of the failed corneal graft revealed a markedly thickened stroma and near complete absence of endothelial cells. Both sides of the excised donor corneal button were covered with epithelial cells, consistent with epithelial downgrowth. (Figure ) The corneal sections containing suture tracks were stained with the periodic acid Schiff stain to demonstrate Descemet's membrane. (Figure ) The suture tracks passed through the true epithelial layer, Bowman's layer, and extended into the stroma, confirming that the button had not been inverted when secured into the recipient opening. Additionally, serial sectioning of the host corneal button failed to demonstrate the presence of epithelial cells on the posterior corneal surface.
To investigate the possibility of HSV infection of the donor cornea, which has been associated with one-third of cases of PGF [,], PCR analysis of the donor corneal button for HSV DNA was performed. Positive and negative controls confirmed adequate extraction of purified DNA from the failed donor corneal button, as well as the sensitivity and specificity of the HSV primers used. PCR analysis for HSV DNA was negative in the donor corneal button.
A complete review of the first donor's medical and eye bank records was performed. The tissue was obtained through the University of California, San Francisco tissue bank from a 56 year-old female donor who died from a myocardial infarction and cardiac tamponade. Routinely performed serologic screening tests and biomicroscopic examination of the donor button were unremarkable. The endothelial cell count was 2852 cells/mm2, and death to preservation was 12 hours, with a 51-hour preservation time in Optisol-GS.
The paired donor cornea was transplanted into another recipient several hours after this patient's original transplant. This cornea also appeared unremarkable on biomicroscopic examination, remained in Optisol-GS for 53 hours prior to transplantation, and had a cell count of 2841 cells/mm2. Five months later, after a similar 16 interrupted suture technique, the graft was clear and compact with central corneal pachymetry of 538 μm."
33,202319,755927,867258,"A 61-year-old man was admitted to the Emergency Department immediately after he experienced global aphasia and right-sided hemiparesis. The clinical diagnosis of acute cerebral ischaemia in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory was made by a neurologist. A cranial CT-scan showed no early signs of cerebral infarct and no intracranial bleeding. Atrial fibrillation was recognised on the initial ECG and an cerebral infarct of cardiac embolic origin was assumed. The patient had no history of stroke but suffered from coronary heart disease and sustained an anterior cardiac wall infarction in the past. Further known vascular risk factors were hypertension and smoking. Even so, the patient took no medication at the time of admission.
Thrombolysis with 70 mg rt-PA (0.9 mg/kg) was started two hours after the onset of symptoms. The neurological status during and after rt-PA treatment remained unchanged. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) performed 12 hours after initiation of thrombolytic therapy revealed a moderately reduced left ventricular systolic function (ejection fraction: 41%), left ventricular regional dyssynergy, and no intracardiac thrombus.
The D-Dimer antigen plasma concentration as a marker of coagulation activation was raised 24 hours after rt-PA treatment and showed a tendency to normalisation during the following days.
Extracranial Duplexsonography revealed moderate arteriosclerotic plaque formation in the carotid bulb on both sides but no hemodynamic stenosis of the carotid and vertebral arteries. Using transcranial duplexsonography a severe stenosis was found in the proximal segment of the left middle cerebral artery. No diabetes or hyperlipidaemia were diagnosed. Cerebral MRI, twenty-four hours after lysis revealed a cortical infarct with a clinically asymptomatic haemorrhagic transformation in the left-sided MCA territory. Antithrombotic treatment with subcutaneous low-dose heparin (Dalteparin 2/d) was initiated 24 hours after thrombolysis. The fluid balance was continuously monitored and kept net 0 ml/24 hours to avoid fluid overload.
On the 3rd day after admission, the patient developed acute dyspnea, tachypnea, tachycardia, and an elevated blood pressure. Acute myocardial infarction was excluded on the basis of ECG and blood tests (CK, CK-MB, Troponin were normal). A CT-scan detected no pulmonary embolism, but massive bilateral pleural effusion. TTE revealed an apical thrombus measuring 2.0 × 2.0 cm in the left ventricle (figure ) with left ventricular ejection fraction reduced to 20%. The thrombus, was fixed to the hypokinetic anteroseptal wall. Serial TTE performed two days later revealed complete resolution of the thrombus and hypokinesia; with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40%. In the mean time the patient recovered from the acute cardiac decompensation. The neurological clinical picture remained stable during the acute phase with a slight improvement of aphasia and hemiparesis within the following 5 weeks."
34,203718,91136,816293,"A 74 year old woman presented with a two day history of haematuria and increasing lethargy one month following palliative radiotherapy to the bladder for a T4 Grade III urothelial carcinoma. Clinical examination revealed large ecchymoses over both upper and lower limbs as well as oral mucosal bleeding without any evidence of petechiae. The patient was apyrexial and vital signs were all within normal limits. There were no other significant findings on cardiovascular, respiratory and abdominal examination.
Laboratory analysis revealed INR 2.7 (normal range: 0.9–1.3), APTT 73 sec (25–38) D-dimer 25 μg/mL (0–0.2), fibrinogen <0.05 g/L (1.5–4.0), platelets 25 × 109/L (150–400), consistent with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Computerised tomographic (CT) scan of the thorax and abdomen revealed a lesion within the right ventricle (Figure ) without other evidence of metastatic disease within the pulmonary or hepatic parenchyma. The primary site appeared necrotic consistent with recent radiotherapy. Trans-oesophageal echocardiography showed that the lesion extended into the body of the right ventricle and significantly reduced ventricular volume (Figure ). The edges of the lesion were fimbriated and mobile, consistent with a metastatic deposit. Although the platelet count and clotting improved with Vitamin K and plasma, the platelet count did not rise above 50. This was adequate in controlling her haematuria and further treatments were therefore not initiated. As the patient did not show any overt signs of thrombosis, we did not institute therapy with anticoagulants. As the patient's functional status was declining, we were unable to consider chemotherapeutic options. Palliative radiotherapy to the heart was considered but the patient deteriorated and died three months later. A request to perform an autopsy was refused by the patient's family."
35,216501,449631,195751,"A 44-year-old female presented with 2 months history of a progressive lump in right breast. She gave a past history of noncyclic mastalgia of two years duration. There was no other significant past history. Patient had undergone abdominal hysterectomy 4 years back for dysfunction uterine bleeding and was on hormone replacement therapy with estrogen alone for the same duration.
On examination there was 4 × 3 cm lump in upper outer quadrant of the right breast with no fixity to skin or underlying tissue. There were no significant axillary or supraclavicular nodes. Abdominal examination failed to show any organomegaly. Routine hematological, biochemical tests, chest roentgenogram, abdominal ultrasonogram and bone scans were normal. Fine needle aspiration cytology revealed Infiltrating duct carcinoma.
Patient was planned for sentinel lymph node biopsy follow by mastectomy. 8 ml of Tc99 sulfur colloid was injected around the tumor and immunoscintigraphy images (anterior and lateral view) were taken. These images failed to show any lymph node uptake either in axilla or else where (figure ) at the time of surgery 4 ml of isosulfan blue was injected peritumorilly and 20 minutes later axilla was entered. Sentinel node detection was also carried out using a hand held gamma probe (Navigator®, Auto sutures). Sentinel lymph node was identified by combined technique in level I axilla lying just posterior to the primary tumor. On gross examination most of the node appeared to be replaced by tumor and only a part of it appeared normal this part was stained blue while rest of the node was white. Histopathology of primary tumors was infiltrating duct carcinoma, with involvement of skin. Sentinel lymph node showed metastatic deposit. Other lymph nodes in axillary dissection specimen were also positive."
36,216501,183822,999861,"A 42-year-old female presented with lump in left breast of 1-month duration. She was a known case of carcinoma breast and had undergone right modified radical mastectomy 7 years back followed by chest wall radiotherapy and 6 cycles of CMF chemotherapy.
On examination there was a 3 × 2 cm lump located in the retro areolar area of left breast. Scar of right mastectomy was seen. There were no palpable axillary nodes or supra clavicular nodes. Systemic examination was normal. Routine hematological and biochemical investigations chest x-ray, abdominal sonography and bone scans were normal. The treatment options were discuss with the patient and she wanted to conserve this breast and hence a wide excision of mass encompassing nipple areola complex, sentinel node biopsy followed by axillary clearance was planned.
On the morning of the surgery 4 ml of Tc99 sulfur colloid was injected peritumorily and scintigraphic images were taken 4 hours later. The scintigraphic image showed one sentinel node in axilla and other in supra clavicular fossa (figure ). At surgery 4 ml of isosulfan blue was injected peritumorilly and sentinel node identification was carried out by combined method. On exploration of axilla the blue and hot sentinel node was identified and removed. However, hand held probe failed to pick a hot spot in supra clavicular fossa axillary dissection was completed.
Histopathology of the resected specimen showed infiltrative duct carcinoma margins of resection were negative. The sentinel node showed deposits from infiltrating duct carcinoma. Post operative period was uneventful and it is planned to start her on radiotherapy to residual breast with 4 cycles of anthracyclin based chemotherapy."
37,250132,113474,244157,"A 30-year old primigravida woman presented to the outpatient department in the fourth month of gestation. She had no past history of psychiatric illness. Her chief complaints were contamination obsessions and washing compulsions in the preceding one month. Preoccupied with thoughts of contamination, she had started spending the majority of time washing herself or cleaning various household items. She described these thoughts as being her own and recognised them to be ""irrational"", but she could not resist them. She was distressed and unable to maintain her employment. Washing compulsions relieved her anxiety. However, she could not offer an explanation as to what she feared about contamination. No depressive or psychotic symptoms were elicited. Biochemical investigations, including metabolic and thyroid function studies, were in the normal range. She was diagnosed with OCD according to ICD-10 criteria [].
Pharmacotherapy, offered at the first consultation, was refused by the patient because of her (non-obsessional) concerns about teratogenic effects of drugs. Behavioural therapy in the form of thought stopping was begun. The patient reported exacerbation of symptoms at the next consultation and subsequently disclosed that her obsessional thoughts also concerned the fear of contaminating her unborn baby. She repeatedly washed to avoid damage to her foetus. One month after her initial presentation, fluoxetine was started, at an initial dose of 20 mg/day gradually and gradually increased to 60 mg/day over the next four weeks. The patient reported reduction of obsessional and compulsive symptoms, and was able to resume her work. She remained on fluoxetine until the eighth month of pregnancy with no reports of exacerbation. However, the patient stopped the medication during the last month of gestation on the alleged advice of family members. The patient again experienced the relapse of intrusive obsessional thoughts followed by compulsions, but refused to resume pharmacotherapy until delivery. The patient returned to the outpatient clinic fifteen days postpartum. The patient described no obsessive thoughts or washing compulsions for the preceding one week. She was followed up for five visits in the next one year without any reports of obsessions or compulsions."
38,250132,149706,615699,"A 22 year-old male presented with anemia. Colonoscopy revealed eight hyperplastic to adenomatous polyps ranging in size from 0.6 to 3.0 cm scattered through the colon, and a four cm, locally invasive, ulcerative rectal adenocarcinoma five cm from the anus. The clinical impression was attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (AFAP), with a germline heterozygous truncating APC mutation at codon 215 (CAG to TAG; Gln to stop). The first sample for methylation analysis (Day 1) was a biopsy of normal appearing sigmoid colon.
The patient received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of three, two week cycles of oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil, with the last cycle ending two weeks before colectomy. The patient exhibited Grade 3 toxicity with mucositis, stomatitis, diarrhea, and parasthesia. He also received radiation therapy to the pelvis (2,500 centigrays over five days), ending 19 days before colectomy. The specimens obtained for analysis were outside of the primary radiation field.
Colectomy revealed approximately 50 scattered small hyperplastic to adenomatous polyps (0.1 to 0.3 cm), and a 0.7 cm ulcerative lesion at the site of the rectal adenocarcinoma containing a few residual neoplastic glands with superficial invasion of the muscularis propria. Lymph nodes were negative for metastatic carcinoma. The second specimen for analysis (Day 62) was taken from a normal appearing region of the sigmoid colon.
Individual crypts were isolated from the first (a colonoscopic biopsy) and last (a 1–2 cm2 patch of mucosa) specimens using an EDTA-containing solution as previously described []. DNA, extracted from individual crypts placed in microfuge tubes, was bisulphite treated (to convert C's to U's, whereas methylated-C's are unchanged), and amplified by PCR at two different CpG rich regions called CSX (nine different crypts) and BGN (eight of the same crypts). PCR products were cloned into bacterial vectors and eight clones representing individual PCR products were sequenced from each crypt [].
Crypt patterns (5' to 3' order of methylation) before and after neo-adjuvant therapy were complex and seemingly random, consistent with stochastic epigenetic errors (Figure ). The CSX (cardiac specific homeobox) sequence or ""tag"" is autosomal (5q34, also called Mint23 []) and has eight CpG sites located in the 3' untranslated region and 256 possible patterns ([]8 possible 5' to 3' orders of methylation). The BGN (biglycan) tag is on the X-chromosome (Xq28, one allele per male cell) and has nine CpG sites located just distal to the promoter and 512 ([]9) possible patterns. These tags are not expressed in the colon and therefore any methylation is unlikely to confer selection []. Crypt methylation patterns are summarized by two statistics: percent methylation (proportion of methylated CpG sites) and diversity or numbers of unique tags per eight sampled from each crypt.
Methylation tag values differed between crypts sampled before and after neo-adjuvant therapy, but these differences were not significant and did not follow a trend (Figure ). Average CSX tag values were lower and BGN tags values were higher after neo-adjuvant therapy. A model [] in which random methylation errors start to accumulate from birth is consistent with the lack of significant tag differences between serial specimens and the observed crypt variations. The model can be simulated on a computer (using previously published human colon crypt parameters []) to estimate average tag values and intervals that include 95% of simulated individual crypt outcomes (Figure ). Different crypts within the same colon may have different methylation patterns because errors are stochastic and independent between cells and CpG sites. Methylation patterns before and after neo-adjuvant therapy are predicted to be similar because additional errors acquired in the 62 days between the samples are relatively insignificant compared to the 22 years since birth. Observed crypt tag values were generally consistent with the predictions of the model (Figure ).
In addition to numbers of divisions since birth, methylation patterns (Figure ) may also record stem cell dynamics. For example, crypt diversity or unique tags per crypt appears to reflect crypt stem cell numbers []. This AFAP patient appeared to have normal numbers of crypt stem cells because his crypt diversity (3.22 and 2.33 average unique CSX crypt tags) was consistent with a normal colon (Figure ). In contrast, significantly greater crypt diversity has been observed in some familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients, with an average of 3.9 unique CSX tags per FAP crypt compared to 3.0 with non-FAP crypts, which translates to about 4-fold more FAP crypt stem cells []. Greater numbers of crypt stem cells correlate with germline APC mutations around the mutation cluster region (MCR) that remove some but not all β-catenin binding repeats []. Consistent with this observation, this patient had a truncating germline mutation (Codon 215, CAG (Gln) to TAG (stop)) that removed all β-catenin binding repeats."
39,254301,99200,531165,"This 34-year-old woman was a case of Gaucher disease type I with initial presentation of hepatosplenomegaly and severe bone diseases including fractures of the lower extremities and bone crisis at childhood. She was the second of a pair of twins. Her twin sister and another younger sister are both affected. There is no consanguinity in the family. She underwent splenectomy at age 5 years due to persistent thrombocytopenia, but the diagnosis of Gaucher disease was established only after a bone marrow examination at age 11 years. Her leukocytes β-glucocerebrosidase activity checked at age 26 years was 1.56 nmol/mg/h (normal: >28.42 nmol/mg/h). At that time, she had severe bone deformities, hepatomegaly, anemia, clubbing fingers and toes, but pink lips. There was no audible heart murmur, and her breathing sound was clear. Her liver size was measured 5 cm below subcostal margin at right mid-clavicular line, and neither spider angiomata nor superficial vein engorgement was found. Hemogram revealed a platelet count of 103 × 109/L and hemoglobin level of 9.6 mg/dL. DNA analysis of this patient and her two affected siblings all revealed a V375L/L444P genotype of the β-glucocerebrosidase gene.
The patient complained of bilateral orbital pain with gradual protrusion of eyes since 30 years old. Thyroid function tests, including T3, T4, thyroid-stimulating hormone and free T4, showed normal results. Ophthalmologic examinations failed to reveal any specific findings related to the exophthalmos. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the eyes revealed increases in retrobulbar space with fat-like density and mild hypertrophy of extra-ocular muscles (Fig. ). She received enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with imiglucerase (Cerezyme) at a dose of 60 U/kg every two weeks since 32 years old. Her exophthalmos progressed slightly during the first year of ERT, and then started to regress. Exposure conjunctivitis still bothered her currently.
The patient suffered from intermittent dyspnea at age 34 years. She became cyanotic and had an oxygen saturation of 85% as measured by pulse oximeter. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed a pH of 7.41, carbon dioxide tension of 27.9 mmHg, and oxygen tension of 61.2 mmHg in room air. A grade III/VI bruit was audible over the right lower chest, and a chest x-ray revealed prominent pulmonary conus and increased infiltration over the right lower lung field (Fig. ). A high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest suspected an AVM with engorged right inferior pulmonary artery and its draining veins (Fig. ); but no focal lesions were found in the lung parenchyma. Right pulmonary artery angiogram showed several dilated and tortuous vessels from the right pulmonary artery, which directly connected to vessels draining into the right pulmonary vein over the right lower lobe of the lung (Fig. ). Early appearance of contrast medium in the right pulmonary vein indicated the presence of pulmonary arteriovenous malformation. The patient's pulmonary artery pressures were 48/19 mmHg (mean, 33 mmHg). Embolization was achieved with 6 coils, and resulted in a rise of oxygen saturation to 96%, although residual shunt was still present. Unfortunately, two months later, dyspnea and cyanosis recurred, and her oxygen saturation dropped to 85% in room air. A pulmonary function test at that time revealed moderately severe restrictive lung disease."
40,254301,126630,311058,"In Sep. 1994, a 27-year-old woman (gravida 3, para 3) was referred to Gynecology Oncology Unit in Vali-e-Asr Hospital, Tehran, Iran. Her previous pregnancy was terminated at 40 weeks, with vaginal delivery in May 1991. After a few months of abnormal uterine bleeding, she underwent dilatation and curettage and then a total abdominal hysterectomy (2 months before referral). Histology of the resected specimen revealed choriocarcinoma.
Upon her first visit to our clinic, she was in respiratory distress, and had cough with bloody sputum. Physical examination revealed no abnormal finding except wheezing. Chest X-ray and computerized tomographic (CT) scan showed multiple metastatic nodules in both lungs parenchyma (Figure ). Abdominal and pelvic CT was normal. Histology was reviewed by two expert pathologists in our center, and PSTT was confirmed (Figure ). Serum β-hCG level was 210 mIU/ml. Serial serum β-hCG ranged between 170 – 250, and increased after 3 courses of combination chemotherapy with methotrexate, actinomycin and cyclophosphamide.
Three years later, in november 1994, the patient was given three cycles of EMA chemotherapy. However, due to plateau titer of β-hCG the chemotherapy regimen was changed to EMA-CE. Reassessment of staging work-up was performed using pelvic ultrasonography that revealed a hypoechoic mass in right ovary (42 mm). At the end of six courses of EMA-CE chemotherapy, serum β-hCG remained at 50 mIu/ml.
In May 1995, patient underwent laparotomy and right oophrectomy one month following which the serum β-hCG was negative. Patient is on regular follow-up (clinical exam, β-hCG tests, pelvic and abdominal sonography and chest CT) and has shown no signs of local or systemic recurrence."
41,255289,406681,272022,"We report a case of an 82-year-old man admitted to the hospital with melaena and dizziness on standing.
He had a past medical history of SSc diagnosed 3 years before and pulmonary fibrosis. He was on prednisolone and azathioprine. There was no history of liver disease or alcohol abuse.
On examination his blood pressure of 95/65 mmHg, pulse 90/min. He had bilateral fine inspiratory crackles. The abdomen was soft and non-tender. Rectal examination revealed melaena.
White blood count was 12,700/mm3, haemoglobin 10.9 g/dl, platelets 186,000/mm3 and MCV 99.4 fl. Blood urea was 12.5 mmol/l, creatinine 68 μmol/l, electrolytes were normal, glucose 6.3 mmol/l. Serum alanine aminotransferase was 12 u/l, bilirubin 12 μmol/l, γ-glutamyl transferase 54 u/l, alkaline phosphatase 35 u/l, total protein 52 g/l, albumin 27 g/l and C-reactive protein 12. Coagulation studies were normal. Factor V Leiden mutation was not present. Hepatitis viral serology and autoantibody screen were negative and α-1-antitrypsin was normal. Ferritin was 103 μmol/l, caeruloplasmin was 0.25 μmol/l and α-fetoprotein was 0.9 kU/L.
Urgent gastroscopy revealed oesophageal varices, fresh blood and clots in the stomach. During the procedure the oesophageal varices started bleeding. Haemostasis was not achieved despite sclerotherapy and therefore a Sengstaken tube was inserted. The patient was admitted to the High Dependency Unit and commenced on intravenous glypressin, antibiotics and was transfused four units of blood. The following day a repeat gastroscopy showed two columns of grade II oesophageal varices, two oesophageal ulcers (probably secondary to sclerotherapy) and mild portal gastropathy.
Ultrasound scan of the abdomen revealed a small liver with coarse texture and no focal lesion. Hepato-portal flow was demonstrated in the portal vein. The common bile duct was of normal caliber. The spleen was enlarged (bipolar length 12.8 cm). A moderate amount of free peritoneal fluid was noted. CT scan confirmed the absence of portal vein thrombosis.
The patient was discharged three weeks following admission on propranolol 40 mg twice daily, azathioprine 50 mg twice daily, spironolactone 100 mg once daily, prednisolone 7.5 mg once daily, lansoprazole, vitamin D and calcium. He had two further endoscopies, one and five weeks following discharge and his varices were successfully treated with banding. One month following discharge he had a liver biopsy. There was no evidence of any excess inflammation and no features to suggest cirrhosis or drug-induced liver disease. Overall this was essentially normal liver tissue.
Taking into account the liver histology and the absence of evidence of portal vein thrombosis on imaging we concluded that the patient had IPH. We decided not to proceed to portal pressure measurement because this would not contribute to the management of the patient.
Two months following discharge the patient was reviewed and was well. He had not had any further episodes of haematemesis or melaena. He had normal full blood count and biochemistry results."
42,255289,578604,786045,"A 28-year-old male presented with a dull ache and photophobia in the right eye following blunt ocular trauma. Three days earlier he had been hit in the right eye with a cricket ball. There were no other ocular complaints or significant past ocular history. The patient was in excellent general health and was not taking any medications.
On examination, his corrected visual acuities were 6/12 and 6/6 in the right and left eye respectively. Intraocular pressures were 19 mm Hg in each eye. Biomicroscopy revealed a moderate traumatic iritis in the right eye. After pupillary dilatation, ocular examination revealed a clear lens with an annular pigment band on the posterior capsule in the right eye. No other signs of blunt trauma were detected on a detailed examination of the anterior and posterior segments. The examination of left eye was within normal limits. There was no evidence of any pigmentation on the posterior capsule in the left eye. The patient was treated with mild steroids (prednisolone acetate 0.5% q.i.d) and cycloplegics (cyclopentolate 1%) for a week.
During follow-up evaluation of the patient after two weeks, visual acuities were 6/6 in both eyes. The traumatic iritis in the right eye had resolved. On a detailed evaluation of the right eye, no sequelae of blunt trauma were found. However, the annular pigment band on the posterior capsule of right eye persisted. A directed examination was performed in both eyes for signs of pigment dispersion syndrome. A re-examination of posterior corneal surface did not reveal Krukenberg's spindle or any other pigment deposition patterns in either eye. In both eyes, the anterior chamber was of normal depth with no noticeable concavity of the peripheral iris. There were no transillumation defects in the iris on careful retroillumination. Gonioscopy revealed open angles without any evidence of hyperpigmentation or angle recession in either eye. The cup to disc ratios were 0.3 in both eyes with a healthy neuroretinal rim. On direct questioning, there was no significant family history of glaucoma or other ocular disorders."
43,264872,211115,445895,"A 33-years-old woman with no significant past medical history complained of abdominal right upper quadrant discomfort associated with an history of weight lost (8 kg over 2 months). Physical examination revealed a right upper quadrant mass on deep palpation. Routine hematology and blood biochemistry were normal. The patient was HIV1-2 negative. Chest and abdominal roentgenograms were considered normal. Abdominal ultrasonography (USG) revealed a large hypoechogenic mass, with regular border in the right anterior peri-renal space. Computed tomography (CT) scan showed a 10 × 8 cm mass with regular contour, containing small calcifications, which strongly enhanced with vascular contrast. The lesion was in contact with the right kidney and ureter. Surgery was planned with a preoperative diagnosis of malignant retroperitoneal tumor versus lymph node hyperplasia.
Through a right transverse incision, after mobilization of the duodeno-pancreatic bloc, a tumor was found in contact of the right kidney, ureter and caval vein. While the possibility of malignancy could not be neglected, the mass was dissected en-bloc with wide margin in peri-renal fat. To allow free surgical margin clinically a segment of the right ureter as well as inferior pole of kidney were also excised en bloc. A right nephrectomy was finally performed latter on as the ureteral defect could not be repaired.
Histopathological examination of resected specimen revealed localized Castleman's disease of the hyaline vascular type. Patient had smooth postoperative recovery and is free of disease more than 6 years after resection."
44,264872,629314,875957,"A 25-year-old woman with no significant past medical history, presented with post-prandial epigastric discomfort evolving over 2 years and post-prandial vomiting since 1 month. The patient reported 2.5 kg weight loss over 2 months. Physical examination revealed a left para-renal mass on deep palpation. Blood analyses were not relevant. CEA and CA19-9 were in the normal range. The patient was HIV1-2 negative. Chest and abdominal X-ray films were considered normal. An upper abdominal barium follow through was considered normal. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a 6 cm diameter hypoechogenic mass in the left peri-renal space. CT scan showed a 6 × 7 cm mass, containing multiple small calcifications, which was highly hypervascular and regular in shape (figure ). An arteriography confirmed the presence of hypervascularity with flushing of the mass (figure ). Surgery was planned with a preoperative diagnosis of malignant retroperitoneal tumor.
At laparotomy a 7 cm diameter mass was found in the left anterior peri-renal space, just inferior to the renal artery. The lesion was completely excised with what seems, clinically, to be a capsule. No organ resection was needed.
Pathologic diagnosis was localized Castleman's disease of the hyaline vascular type. Patient had had a simple postoperative period, except of persisting lumbar pain, attributed to a small inferior renal infarct (confirmed by CT scan). The patient is free of disease 5-years after resection."
45,288543,353887,57315,"A 37-year-old female farmer reported to suffer from daily asthmatic complaints by milking of cows with a conventional device. Exposure associated respiratory symptoms increased continuously during a period of 12 years. Allergic bronchial asthma, caused by sensitization against cow dust-derived allergens, was diagnosed by a positive skin prick test (Bencard®) and by the detection of IgE antibodies against Bos d 2 at 74.9 kIU/l (Pharmacia, UniCAP®). Moreover, nonspecific bronchial hyperresponsiveness was verified by a positive histamine inhalation challenge test. The diagnosis of occupational asthma was confirmed by a separate specific inhalation challenge test using a 10% extract of cow hair allergens which led to a 330% increase of airway resistance (Raw).
The German Professionals insurance laws require complete elimination of allergen exposures for the compensation of occupational allergic asthma as occupational disease []. Legal consequence would usually be to abandon dairy farming. However, in our case presented, dairy farming substantially contributed to family-income and the compensation offered would be insufficient for subsistence. Hyposensitization is the most effective measure in the prevention of allergic symptoms in patients with asthma. In that farmer the hyposensitization was not feasible due to permanent exposure to allergens. This farmer did not wear a helmet during the milking process because of claustrophobic panic attacks (fear of suffocation). Moreover an immunotherapy with recombinant lipocalins is currently not available.
Respirator helmets have been predominantly used as effective measures for prevention of the inhalation of fumes and dusts []. Investigations about the effectiveness of respirator helmets against high-molecular allergens to prevent allergic asthma are rare. Taivainen et al. (1998) demonstrated that due to the use of a dust respirator helmet with a P2-class filter, dairy farmers with occupational asthma induced by cow dander showed less rhinitic symptoms and an improved peak flow rate []. However, workers using respirator helmets were not prevented against a progressive behavior of occupational asthma [,]. Thus it is to doubt whether respirator helmets are efficient in farmers with occupational asthma to provide a complete protection against allergens [].
To enable further dairy farming, the farmer installed a milking robot in 1999, i.e., an automatic milking system (AMS). At present circa 1300 AMS are installed, predominantly in the Netherlands, followed by Germany. AMS were developed in the course of increasing automation of the agricultural production. AMS consist of a milking box with the milking equipment and an electronic controlling system, an automatically operating dosing unit of a specific food-concentrate as well as a software controlled management system. The cows are decoyed from a specific food-concentrate to enter the milking box. A transponder, fixed on the cow neck, initiates milking operations automatically controlled by software and laser. The milking robot operates in the cowshed, which is air-shielded from the control-centre. After the installation of AMS the farmer was involved only in terms of monitoring the milking process. Figure shows the job and the current exposure situation of the farmer. It is apparent that the novel milking technique reduced exposure significantly by some 90% (from over 2 hours to approx. 10 min.) without a decline of milk production. Beyond allergen exposure reduction, the physical workload was lessened and the time available for activities to improve coping was increased – these factors are increasingly recognized as relevant for the prognosis of asthma []. Table shows the influence of the AMS technique on the current occupational exposure of the farmer. According to German Professionals insurance laws all conceivable measures must be taken into account even AMS is an expensive technical device to prevent occupational asthma.
After installation of the milking robot the farmer reported significantly less frequent allergic and asthmatic symptoms. Asthma medication was reduced and required only once daily in the evening. Improvement was noted also in terms of lung-function and decreased total serum IgE: serum IgE decreased from 1332 IU/ml before milking robot installation to 572 and 474 IU/ml two and three years after installation, respectively. FEV1 improved by 20% and vital capacity by 11%, comparing values one year before with two years after installation. A CAP-RAST score ""5"" versus Bos d 2 was determined after the intervention. Preceding EAST-Test results vs. Bos d 2 were not suitable for comparison.
Current discussions address threshold limit values for allergens that may prevent allergic symptoms []. These have been proposed also for the cow dust-derived allergen Bos d 2 []. Table shows examples for successful measures of exposure minimization at workplaces to reduce sensitizations. Recent studies have already demonstrated that allergen exposure reduction at workplaces is successful in reducing sensitizations, e.g., to latex proteins [,], laboratory animals [] or acid anhydrides []."
46,288543,878623,105176,"A 51-year-old male was admitted in June 2001, due to hemosputum, cough, hemo-stool and an abnormal shadow on a chest roentgenogram. Laboratory results showed severe anemia with hemoglobin of 4.0 g/dl (13.6 < normal range < 16.8 g/dl) and hematocrit of 16.0 % (40 < normal range < 48 %). The patient's chest X-ray demonstrated a huge mass lesion in the left upper lung field (Figure ). Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed a mass shadow, measuring 7.0 × 7.0 cm in size in the left upper lobe (S1+2) without any invasion of the surrounding tissue such as the vessels, plexus or thoracic wall and with no mediastinal lymph node swelling. Abdominal CT revealed a huge mass, measuring 12.7 × 7.5 cm in size in the small intestine. Prior to performing any treatment for the presumed lung cancer, we tried to stop the continuous bleeding from tumor in the small intestine. As a result, we performed an emergency operation. The tumor was observed in the jejunum at a location about 30 cm from the ligament of Treitz on the anal side and a 25 cm length of the jejunum, including the tumor, was thus resected. Six days later, the patient experienced sudden chest pain, dyspnoea and hemoptysis. The patient's chest X ray showed the left lung mass shadow to have rapidly increased in size, while the broncho-fiberscopy findings showed bleeding from the left upper bronchus and an obstruction of the left lower bronchus due to coagulation. Hemothorax due to a rupture of the lung induced by the rapid growth of the tumor was found after an emergency thoracotmy. The tumor was so large that it was difficult to approach the interlobular pulmonary artery. Therefore, a left pneumonectomy with mediastinal lymph nodal dissection was performed. Thereafter, intraoperative intrapleural hypotonic cisplatin treatment [] was performed because some tumor cells were suspected to exist in the pleural cavity due to the rupture of the tumor. A histological examination revealed pure giant cell carcinoma containing no sarcomatoid component, similar to that found in the small intestine (Figure ). As a result, we diagnosed the patient to have stage IV disease (pathological stage T2N0M1) according to the TNM classification []. The patient had an uneventful recovery without any complications. However, about 4 months after the first operation, the patient was diagnosed to have a recurrence at another site in the small intestine and spleen by abdominal CT. The patient received 2 cycles of chemotherapy (cisplatin 40 mg/m2 + gemcitabine 800 mg/m2+ vinorelbine 20 mg/m2), at days 1 and 8, and thereafter every 4 weeks). The splenic metastases increased in size while the size of the tumor in the small intestine decreased. At this time, no recurrence site except for those in the small intestine and spleen were found, therefore, to avoid the risk of bleeding either from tumors in the small intestine or a rupture of spleen in the future, surgical treatment consisting of a partial resection of the small intestine and a splenectomy was performed. The intestinal tumor was found in the jejunum at a location about 10 cm from the ligament of Treitz on the anal side and a total 20 cm length of the jejunum, including the tumor, was resected. A pathological examination revealed a proliferation of pure giant cell carcinoma with extensive necrosis both in the small intestine and the spleen, thus suggesting the chemotherapy to be effective in the both organs. Thereafter, the patient received 2 additional cycles of this triplet chemotherapy. The patient experienced neither any hematological nor severe non-hematological adverse events. About 6 months later, metastases in multiple abdominal lymph nodes were found (Figure ). The patient was started on chemotherapy (carboplatin AUC = 2 + paclitaxel 60 mg/m2, on days 1 and 8, and thereafter every 3 weeks). After receiving a total of 10 cycles of chemotherapy on an outpatient basis, abdominal CT showed the chemotherapeutic effect to be a complete response (Figure ), without any severe hematological or non-hematological adverse events. At present, the patient has survived for about 3-years since the first operation and a complete response has been maintained for 15 months."
47,289368,763886,444433,"A 58-year-old male was brought to the emergency room with confusion and an inability to speak for 1 day. He had a past history of hypertension and hypomania. He was single and he lived alone. On physical examination, his blood pressure was 80/63 mm of Hg, heart rate 126/minute, and temperature 102°F. He was awake but unable to speak due to a mixed receptive and expressive aphasia. He had right homonymous hemianopsia and hemiplegia. Cardiac examination was positive for a pansystolic murmur in the apical area. The abdominal examination was unremarkable. On rectal examination there was perianal erythema and diminished sphincter tone. Complete blood count showed WBC 15,400/mm3 with a left shift, hematocrit 49%, and normal platelets. Serum chemistries showed glucose 84 mg/dl, albumin 2.9 mg/dl, and calcium 8.5 mg/dl. Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the brain, including diffusion weighted imaging, revealed acute hemorrhagic infarction of the left occipital lobe and acute embolic infarctions of the left frontal and right occipital lobes (Fig and ). Transesophageal Echocardiogram demonstrated mitral regurgitation and large vegetations on the posterior leaf of the mitral valve. Splenic and renal infarcts were visible on Computerized Tomography of the abdomen. All of the blood culture bottles and the urine culture grew methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Treatment of the bacterial endocarditis was started with intravenous nafcillin and gentamicin. The patient had a significant recovery of speech and motor function within a few days. When asked about recent dental work, he gave a history of a tooth extraction 2–3 days before the hospitalization but was unable to provide information about his dentist. A dentist from the hospital examined the patient and found no clinical evidence of the extraction. The patient underwent a complete neuropsychiatric evaluation. He displayed confabulation and perseverance (marriage, retirement, hospitalization were reported using the same date which was his birthday). He also had significant executive dysfunction including concrete thinking and poor insight regarding his health and cognitive problems. On hospital day 12 the patient had mitral valve replacement surgery using a bioprosthetic valve. He completed a six-week course of intravenous antibiotic treatment. He also underwent extensive rehabilitation therapy and was sent home after 8 weeks of hospitalization. On subsequent follow-up visits the patient showed complete recovery from the stroke and was back to his baseline. In response to questions about his sexual history the patient indicated having heterosexual relations with multiple partners. However, his answers were inconsistent and seemed unreliable.
A closer examination of his medical records revealed that two years prior to this hospitalization, the patient was admitted with a plastic soda bottle retained in the rectosigmoid for 3 days. The bottle had been filled with warm water and inserted into his anal canal for sexual stimulation. It slipped all the way into the rectum and could not be retrieved. His attempts to extract it at home were unsuccessful. In the emergency room his physical examination was normal except for a palpable mass in the suprapubic area, decreased anal sphincter tone and a dilated rectal vault. On X-ray of the abdomen, the outline of a plastic bottle was visible in the rectosigmoid (Fig ). The patient was taken to the operating room and under spinal anesthesia the bottle was extracted. He had multiple lacerations of the rectal mucosa but there was no perforation. He went home the next day. On follow-up visits to primary care he was noted to be overall healthy except having mild hypertension. His behavior was indicative of hypomania, but he did not get a formal psychiatric evaluation.
Foreign bodies in the rectum and methods of their extraction have been amply chronicled in the surgical literature []. Sexual stimulation is the reason in a majority of these cases []. Local trauma, perforation, and resultant peritonitis are well known complications []. An unlimited PUBMED search for articles on bacteremia or endocarditis related to rectal foreign body insertion was unfruitful (We tried MeSH terms anal/rectal/colorectal/foreign bodies/anorectal /sexual deviation for the purpose). Bacteremia and septicemia from barium enema [], and therapeutic anal dilatation [] have been published. Procedures like fiberoptic sigmoidoscopy are known to cause endocarditis [], but septic stroke resulting from endocarditis related to lower gastrointestinal instrumentation has also not been reported.
The patient's history of anorectal insertion of a plastic soda bottle for sexual gratification is consistent with published reports of use of large objects for this purpose []. The resultant rectal trauma can easily lead to bacteremia. Rectal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus is well documented and is a potential source of infection []. This organism tends to be more abundant on the rectal mucosa than within the feces []. In a study of gastrointestinal colonization, Staphylococcus aureus grew from the culture of rectal swabs in 60% cases versus 53% positive culture of nasal swabs taken from the same subjects []. This organism is known to cause endocarditis of normal heart valves [,]. Neurologic complications of infective endocarditis, particularly embolic events, tend to be higher in cases of endocarditis caused by Staphylococcus aureus [].
It is known that few patients with rectal foreign bodies will freely admit to transanal introduction []. This explains to some extent the paucity of literature linking this practice with bacteremia or endocarditis. We believe our patient was habituated to rectal insertion of foreign bodies and that is evident from his previous history along with the clinical findings of perianal erythema and diminished sphincter tone []. In the absence of a reliable history from the patient, the link between endocarditis and rectal trauma in this case is based on circumstantial evidence. A further study of patients with well-documented evidence of rectal foreign body insertion could be the next step to explore this important observation."
48,289368,360768,538751,"Patient B was a 63-year-old female patient with rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive RA. She had been unsuccessfully treated over a time period of 7 years with three different disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug regimens including methotrexate. The patient has not yet been treated with a tumour necrosis factor alpha blocking therapy. After informed consent, she was treated with rituximab according to the same protocol as patient A. In addition, patient B continued to receive 20 mg methotrexate weekly. She did not receive any glucocorticoids during the study.
The analysis of lymphocyte subsets by immunofluorescence staining was performed by incubating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with anti-CD19 and anti-CD3 antibodies (Phycoerythrin (PE) or Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled as indicated; all antibodies from Becton-Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) using a FACSCalibur (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA, USA). Frequencies of cell populations were calculated using CellQuest software.
Disease activity was regularly determined using the disease activity score (DAS28 index) and by monitoring C-reactive protein (CRP) levels.
Genomic DNA was isolated from PBMCs using the QIAamp® DNA Blood Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Rearranged VHDJH gene rearrangements were amplified for all VH families using a nested PCR approach []. Genomic DNA was amplified in separate reactions for the six VH families (VH1 oligonucleotide primers also co-amplify perfectly VH7 gene rearrangements). The final concentrations of the reagents were 200 μM each dNTP (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany), 0.625 μM each primer, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 10 × PCR buffer II and 2.5 U AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
During the external amplification round, 250 ng (5 μl) DNA were amplified in a 75 μl reaction containing primers specific for the leader peptide sequence and a mixture of external JH primers in a Gene Amp PCR System 2400 (Perkin Elmer, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The internal amplification round was conducted with the 5' primer specific for framework region FR1 and a mixture of internal JH primers using 5 μl of the product of the first amplification reaction as template. The cycling parameters have been described previously []. Briefly, the annealing temperatures were 50°C for the external amplification round and 65°C for the internal round.
The polymerase error rate for the amplification of VH genes using nested PCR has been documented to be 1 × 10-4 mutations/bp [].
Total cellular RNA was extracted from 1 × 107 PBMCs after lysis of the cells in 1.5 ml TRIZOL reagent (Gibco, Karlsruhe, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions.
The RT-PCR reaction was performed using Titan One Tube RT-PCR system (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). First-strand cDNA was synthesised at 42°C for 60 min in a 50 μl reaction mix containing 5 mM dithiothreitol, 400 ng oligo-dT15, 200 μM dNTP, 8 U RNAse inhibitor, 5 × RT-PCR buffer, 20 U high-fidelity enzyme mix RT-AMV and 1 μg RNA. VH mRNA transcripts were amplified by the nested PCR protocol described earlier using 5 μl cDNA and C-region primers (Cμ, TCA GGA CTG ATG GGA AGC CC; Cγ, CGA GCC GCT GGT CAG AGC G; Cα, ACC CTC AGC GGG AAG ACC TT) as the 3' primers in the first round.
All PCR products were separated by electrophoresis through 1.5% agarose and were visualised with ethidium bromide. Successful amplifications were identified as a band corresponding to a product of approximately 350 bp. The bands were excised and subsequently purified using the MinElute Gel extraction kit (Qiagen). The purified PCR products were polished using the PCR polishing kit (Stratagene, Amsterdam Zuidoost, The Netherlands), were ligated with Zero Blunt pCR-blunt vector and were transformed into One Shot® TOP10 cells (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany)
Plasmid DNA from clones containing gene inserts was prepared using the Wizard Plus SV Minipreps DNA Purification System kit (Promega, Mannheim, Germany). The DNA sequences were determined using BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Perkin Elmer, Applied Biosystems) and the M13 forward and reverse universal primers in an automated genetic analyser ABI PRISM 310 (Applied Biosystems). Germline immunoglobulin V genes were identified by blast searching the VBase Sequence Directory [].
The procedure for single cell sorting and subsequent PCR amplifications has been described previously []. Briefly, single CD19+CD27- and CD19+CD27+ cells were sorted into wells of 96-well plates using a FACStar Plus flow cytometer with an automated single cell deposit unit (Beckton-Dickinson, USA). After primer extension pre-amplification, the rearranged VHDJH genes were amplified by nested PCRs using the same oligonucleotides as those already described. After gel purification (Qiagen), the PCR products were directly sequenced using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction kit (Perkin Elmer, Applied Biosystems) and the 5' V primer used for the internal amplification.
The statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad software . Sequences were analysed by the Fisher's exact test to compare the differences in the distribution of particular gene segments. The average lengths of CDR3 were studied by the unpaired t test. The chi-square test was used to compare the mutational frequencies.
Figure shows the clinical response of RA patient A during the two treatment periods with rituximab. B cells accounted for 10.1% of peripheral lymphocytes at the beginning of the study. A rapid B-cell depletion occurred after each therapy, and lasted up to 7 months and 10 months, respectively. The time points of 7 months and 27 months were the first times where B cells were detectable in peripheral blood, either by flow cytometry or by PCR (data not shown). The B-cell frequency was 3% of total lymphocytes at 7 months and was 2.4% of total lymphocytes at 27 months (Fig. ). Patient A had an active disease before therapy, as indicated by a high CRP level and a high DAS28 clinical activity index. The disease activity declined continuously after rituximab therapy. The patient had a good clinical response starting from 3 months and lasting over 1 year. We observed a deterioration of the clinical parameters about 13 months after the first therapy. The patient therefore received a second treatment with rituximab at 17 months. Again, patient A presented a clinical improvement following B-cell depletion. The arrows in Fig. indicate the four time points when the B-cell repertoire was studied. Table presents the RF values. The RF activity declined quite rapidly after rituximab therapy and followed the inflammatory activity, with increasing values in relapse and falling values after the second treatment."
49,294687,87509,534010,"A 47-year-old woman weighing 64 kg and with known type 2 diabetes mellitus managed with metformin (500 mg three times daily) presented after she had ingested up to 200 ml from a bottle of 0.8% rotenone solution (Bio Liquid Derris Plus™; PBI Home & Garden Limited, Waltham Cross, UK). The maximum dose ingested would therefore have been 1.6 g, equating to 25 mg/kg. She was bought to the emergency department having been found collapsed and unconscious at home by her family, with a history of vomiting.
Her initial Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score was 3/15 and she was therefore intubated and ventilated; she had no requirement for sedative or paralyzing agents. After intubation, her blood pressure was 93/52 mmHg and heart rate 87 beats/min. Her electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm. Baseline blood investigations showed normal renal function, but liver dysfunction with an elevated alanine transaminase of 233 IU/l. Arterial blood gases showed a severe metabolic acidosis (pH 7.09, arterial O2 tension 24 kPa, arterial CO2 tension 4.3 kPa, HCO3 10.3 mmol/l, base excess -19 and lactate 13 mmol/l). She was therefore commenced on continuous venovenous haemodialysis with lactate-free dialysate and infusion of 50 ml/hour sodium bicarbonate for management of her metabolic acidosis. Computed tomography scanning showed no intracranial abnormalities to explain her reduced GCS. She was transferred to the intensive care unit, and the National Poisons Information Service (London) was contacted for further advice on management.
A brown watery fluid (30 ml), similar to commercially available rotenone in smell and consistency, was noticed via nasogastric aspiration 6 hours after ingestion. Because previous in vitro studies have demonstrated a benefit of NAC and antioxidants in preventing rotenone toxicity in human cell lines [-], she was treated with intravenous NAC (standard Prescott protocol 1979) and other antioxidants (including multivitamins, 5 ml/day ketovite [orally] and 125 mg zinc sulphate three times daily [orally]) empirically. Also, 200 mg/day iron was administered intravenously; this has been shown to activate ATP-dependent potassium channels, which is protective in rotenone-induced toxicity [].
She remained hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation, and her cardiac index on oesophageal Doppler studies was 7.7 l/min per m2 with a stroke volume of 97 ml and systemic vascular resistance index of 470, indicating the presence of a vasodilated high output state. She was therefore commenced on a noradrenaline (norepinephrine) infusion in order to maintain her blood pressure, with a maximum dose 0.35 μg/kg per hour. Repeat cardiac studies using pulse contour cardiac output 12 hours after the initial presentation revealed a worsening cardiac index (2.5 l/min per m2), with a reduced stroke volume of 30 ml and an increased systemic vascular resistance index of 2359, indicating the presence of a vasoconstricted low output state. She was therefore started on dobutamine (maximum dose 10 μg/kg per h) and weaned from the noradrenaline infusion.
After initial stabilization of her clinical state with maximal supportive care, she then started to deteriorate clinically, with signs of cardiovascular collapse and no signs of obvious neurological recovery. At 48 hours after admission she suffered an asystolic cardiac arrest, which did not respond to cardiopulmonary resuscitation. At postmortem there were signs of multiorgan failure, with pulmonary oedema and congestion of the heart, spleen and kidneys. The liver was icteric with centrilobular necrosis and general disintegration."
50,294687,696189,221263,"A 53-year-old female presented with complications of a polypharmacy overdose. Her past medical history included depression, hyperlipidemia, and anorexia nervosa. There was a previous history of amphetamine abuse as well as two prior episodes of polypharmacy overdose. The patient was discovered at home with a Glasgow Coma Score of 11 and was noted to be hypotensive and tachycardic. Soon after transfer to hospital, the patient became unconscious (Glasgow Coma Score, 3) and was intubated. Empty bottles of paroxetine, moclobemide, pravastatin, and alprazolam were found in her house. The patient was not known to be on neuroleptic antipsychotic medications, and had not used amphetamine for at least 1 year.
The patient subsequently developed features of serotonin syndrome [,], with progressive hypotension despite a central venous pressure of 10 mmHg and commencement of norepinephrine to a maximum dose of 2.5 μg/kg/min, as well as 10 l fluid resuscitation on the first day of admission. Additional features of serotonin syndrome included fever (42°C) and generalized hypertonicity, which was complicated by severe rhabdomyolyis (peak creatine kinase level, 109,000 IU/l). Furthermore, there was evidence of coagulopathy, with severe bleeding from puncture sites and the gastrointestinal tract. Investigations confirmed the presence of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.
The patient developed profound metabolic derangement with lactic acidemia (lactate peak, 11.7 mmol/l; pH nadir, 7.14), oliguric ARF, severe hyperkalemia (K+, 9.1 mmol/l at presentation), hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia, and with the subsequent development of ischemic hepatitis (alanine aminotransferase, 4048 U/l; alkaline phosphatase, 92 U/l). On the first intensive care unit day, continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) with a conventional hemofilter was employed for the management of oliguric ARF and hyperkalemia.
Treatment with fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate, platelet and red blood cells was required. Specific treatment of serotonin syndrome was based on therapies described elsewhere [,], and included active cooling, cyproheptadine, a midazolam infusion, and neuromuscular blockade with vecuronium."
51,297103,746445,772110,"A three and a half year old girl, who presented with a croup history of 4 days duration, was transferred to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit because of worsening respiratory distress. The past history was uncontributory except that the patient was an unvaccinated immigrant, living in close contact with her alcoholic grandfather. The patient was immediately intubated, and a grayish nonadherent membrane extending through the glottis down into the larynx was apparent during the procedure. Material from the membranes was sent for cultures and the patient was started on intravenous penicillin and specific antitoxin. Although blood gases improved initially, respirator settings had soon to be increased significantly to sustain a pO2 value above 60 mm Hg (7.9 kPa). A chest roentgenogram revealed extensive bilateral diffuse pulmonary infiltrations (Fig. ). Laboratory findings included white blood cells 70,110 cu mm (70*109/L) with segmented neutrophils 46%, band forms 8%, platelets 134,000 cu mm (134*109/L), CRP 177. Serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase concentrations peaked at 340 U/L and 721 U/L, respectively and serum creatinine increased to 1.4 mg/dL (124 μmol/L). On hospital day 1 she became hypotensive and remained in shock despite escalating doses of inotropic agents. Echocardiographic findings, which were consistent with acute cardiomyopathy, confirmed extremely poor left ventricular contractility (asystole; shortening fraction <5%), despite high dose continuous dobutamine (20 μg.kg-1.min-1) and epinephrine (up to 5 μg.kg-1.min-1) infusions. After having completed 36 hours of hospitalization in the PICU with multiple cardiac arrests, the child was no more responding to resuscitation efforts and died.
Autopsy findings revealed numerous diphtheritic membrane formations extended down into the larynx and further obstructing the distal tracheobronchial tree (Fig. ). Myocardium edema, congestion and mononuclear and neutrophil cell infiltration, completed the clinicopathologic picture of diphtheritic cardiomyopathy. Membrane formations and visceral hemorrhagic necrotic lesions were associated with numerous strains of corynobacterium diphtheriae (producing the typical club-shaped appearance and distributed in a typical Chinese-letter appearance on the smear) (Fig. ). The organism, however, of Gravis type, grew on the Loeffler cultures of portions of membranes, which were received during the intubation. As also expected, the strain was shown to be toxigenic."
52,297103,763139,865599,"A 56-year-old man (varnisher by profession, heavy smoker with 160 pack years) presented in September 2002 with a five month history of cough, fever, night-sweat and a weight loss of 5 kg in 12 months. A bronchoscopy with biopsy revealed a squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. A FDG-PET/CT scanning showed a disseminated praetracheal, aortoal, supraclavicular and infracarinal lymphadenopathy and a spleen metastasis (stage IV) []. The patient received six cycles of Cisplatinum-Gemcitabine chemotherapy, followed by a second line Mitomycine-Vinorelbine polychemotherapy. A re-evaluation after one year revealed liver metastases and increasing mediastinal lymphadenopathy, followed by additionally Taxotere polychemotherapy. A brain magnetic resonance imaging after a pathologically Romberg Test in December 2003 showed a left hemisphere brain metastasis.
At New Year's Day 2004, the patient presented again with a three days history of increasing abdominal pain, diffuse abdominal guarding and rebound tenderness. Laboratory evaluation was without pathological findings except a marked leukocytosis (WBC = 24,000/mm3).
Abdominal CT-scan displayed free intraperitoneal air and a perforated jejunum (Figure ). The patient was operated on with the diagnosis of perforated jejunum. At surgery, a 2 cm mass was found at the surface of a loop of the jejunum with perforation of 1 cm in diameter, furthermore left upper quadrant peritonitis with pus, stool and a fibrin coating. The affected segment of the jejunum was resected with an end-to-end anastomosis and an abdominal lavage was performed. Postoperative pathologic analysis confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic pulmonary carcinoma (Figure ). The surgical margins were negative for tumor. Postoperatively, the patient was given a regular diet on postoperative day four and discharged home fourteen days after surgery. The patient died 8 weeks after surgery at home on tumor progression."
53,307800,496614,261312,"A 67-year-old male presented with a gastric mass incidentally found on the abdominal computed tomography (CT) for routine medical examination. Abdominal CT showed a fungating tumor at the gastric cardia and several lymph node enlargements at the left gastric and celiac axis. Gastric endoscopic examination revealed a huge fungating mass at the cardia, and subsequently mucosal biopsy was performed. Microscopically the biopsy specimen showed proliferations of bland looking hyperplastic foveolar epithelia with basally located small nuclei and fine nuclear chromatin in the heavy inflammatory background (Figure ). Some glands were destructed by inflammatory cell invasion and revealed mild epithelial atypia with mildly increased nuclei and loss of nuclear polarity reminiscent of reactive cellular atypia (Figure ). This biopsy specimen was diagnosed as foveolar epithelial hyperplasia. However, the clinical and endoscopic features of this patient were strongly suggestive of malignancy. The patient underwent radical total gastrectomy with Roux en Y anastomosis. The extent of lymph node dissection included first and second lymph node groups. The resected stomach revealed a huge fungating tumor (Borrmann type 1) at the cardia (Figure ). The tumor measured 7 cm in the greatest diameter. The cut surface of the tumor was whitish gelatinous and the tumor involved the whole layer of the gastric wall (Figure ). The remaining gastric mucosa is grossly unremarkable. Microscopic feature of the resected specimen was very similar to that of the biopsy specimen except an evidence of deep invasion. Microscopically the tumor was sharply demarcated from surrounding mucosa and composed of proliferations of deceptively bland glands lined by mucin-rich columnar cells with small basal nuclei (Figure ). Many glands are cystically dilated especially in deep portion and their glandular lumina were filled with abundant mucin (Figure ). Most of glands were too bland to discriminate from benign foveolar epithelial hyperplasia (Figure and ), but some glands were more complicated or branched with mild to moderate cellular atypia revealing increased nuclei with loss of polarity and prominent nucleoli (Figure ). There was no evidence of individual cell invasion into lamina propria or solid growth of tumor cells. Chronic and acute inflammatory infiltrate was heavily associated within tumor. Well formed bland glands invaded to the serosa with focal desmoplastic reaction in adjacent stroma. Vascular and perineural involvements were associated. Tumor cells metastasized to 6 out of 76 regional lymph nodes. Metastatic tumor cells within regional lymph nodes were also very bland (Figure ). The pathological tumor stage corresponded to stage IIIA (T3N1M0). Immunohistochemically the tumor cells revealed no overexpression of p53 protein but high Ki-67 labelling index suggesting high proliferative activity (Figure ). The tumor cells and intraluminal mucin were diffusely expressed MUC1 (Figure ) and MUC5AC (Figure ) suggesting gastric foveolar phenotype. MUC2 expression was only focally detected (Figure ). The patient has been underwent adjuvant chemotherapy. Abdominal CT taken after 12 months suggested peritoneal carcinomatosis, multiple metastatic foci in the lung, and multiple retroperitoneal lymph node enlargements. The patient has survived with an evidence of multiple distant metastases for 18 months after operation."
54,307800,547702,569095,"A 76-year-old man presented with epigastric pain and dysphagia. Endoscopy revealed grade 1 oesophagitis with a normal stomach and duodenum. Five months later he was readmitted with anorexia, weight loss, dysphagia and anaemia. Endoscopy on this occasion revealed a large pedunculated polypoidal lesion arising from the gastro-oesophageal junction within a hiatus hernia. Pathological examination of biopsies taken from the polyp showed inflammatory changes in squamous mucosa with no evidence of malignancy. As the lesion was pedunculated it was decided to attempt endoscopic snare excision which proved unsuccessful, as the lesion was too large for the snare. At laparotomy a large polypoidal mass was found arising from the distal oesophagus. Through a gastrostomy the lesion was delivered into the abdomen, a linear stapler was applied to the base of the stalk and the lesion was excised. The patient made an uneventful recovery.
The resected specimen (figure ) measured 9 cm × 4 cm × 4 cm and consisted of soft and slimy tissue. Histology showed an intact squamous mucosa and a mass of myxoid fibroblastic tissue with plasma cells and a diffuse eosinophilic infiltrate (figure ). There was no evidence of malignancy. These appearances were consistent with inflammatory fibroid polyp of the oesophagus. Immunohistochemical studies were negative for S 100 and smooth muscle actin excluding neural or smooth muscle origin.
The patient underwent endoscopy 6 months after resection and there was no evidence of recurrence. He is currently asymptomatic 1 year after resection."
55,307975,11826,580541,"A 41-year-old female NF1 patient was admitted for the evaluation of a 3-year history of recurrent epigastric soreness, heartburn, and diarrhea. Repeated endoscopic examinations revealed recurrent duodenal ulcers. The symptoms were relieved by proton-pump inhibitors, but recurred when the medication was withdrawn. She was previously diagnosed with NF1 based on clinical features and family history. Her first-degree relatives (i.e., brother, sister, and second son) were also affected by fully developed features of NF1. She had no cognitive dysfunction or learning disabilities, and showed normal intellectual development. A physical examination revealed several café-au-lait spots and multiple small nodules on the anterior chest and areolar area, and also multiple axillary freckles. A skin-nodule biopsy demonstrated characteristic neurofibromas.
On admission, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed multiple shallow ulcers in the descending duodenum. The rapid urease test and urea breath test for Helicobacter pylori were both negative. The serum fasting gastrin level was >1,000 pg/mL and 837 pg/mL in two consecutive measurements. A secretin stimulation test was not performed due to the unavailability of secretin. As a diagnosis of gastrinoma was strongly suggested, radiologic evaluations were performed to locate the lesion. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans showed a 3 × 2-cm, clearly defined, well-enhanced mass adjacent to the duodenal loop in the subhepatic space (Figure ). No metastatic lesions were observed in the liver or regional lymph nodes.
The association with MEN1 status was evaluated by hormonal and radiologic investigations of the parathyroid, pituitary, pancreas, and adrenal gland, which proved to be negative. As a definitive treatment, an intraabdominal mass of about 2.5 × 2 cm with a thick fibrous capsular outer layer was surgically isolated and completely resected from the right lateral border of the descending duodenum. Gastrinoma was finally diagnosed by immunohistochemical staining (Figures , ). An incidental finding during the operation was numerous, small (<1.0 cm), whitish nodular masses on the serosal surface of the small bowel, many of which were enucleated. The pathologic diagnosis was gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) with a low mitotic index as evidenced by C-kit positivity (Figures , ). The serum gastrin level decreased markedly to 99.1 pg/mL at 1 month after the operation, and to 53.2 pg/mL 3 months later. There were no symptomatic or radiologic recurrences during a 14-month follow up."
56,307975,132940,795831,"A 56-year old Chinese man, who had a known history of asymptomatic gallstones, presented with right upper quadrant abdominal pain for five days associated with fever. Laboratory investigations showed neutrophilia, but the liver function test was normal. Ultrasound examination of the abdomen revealed distended gallbladder associated with multiple gallstones, prominent intrahepatic ducts and enlarged lymph nodes at the porta hepatitis region. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed for a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis showed distended and gross thickened gallbladder and omental adhesions. The bile was turbid and two stones were found impacted at the Hartmann's pouch. The cystic duct was normal. The patient developed post-operative fever and intravenous levofloxacin at a dosage of 500 mg daily was started as empirical treatment. Bile culture subsequently yielded a pure growth of K. kristinae (see microbiology diagnosis). Fever resolved readily after levofloxacin therapy, which was continued orally at the same dosage for a total duration of 14 days. He made an uneventful recovery."
57,315313,254146,283866,"A 43-year-old Caucasian male was referred to the nephrology clinic at Overton Brooks VAMC by his primary care practitioner, in November of 2002 for management of his chronic kidney disease. He was asymptomatic. His BP was well controlled at 115/83 mmHg. He was morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 46, chronic kidney disease stage 4 (MDRD GFR of 16 ml/min), non insulin dependant diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease status post stent placement and hyperlipidemia. His medications included nifedipine, fosinopril, atenolol, rosiglitazone, furosemide, simvastatin, aspirin, glyburide and calcium carbonate. Laboratory results: Serum creatinine 4.3 mg/dl, BUN 54 mg/dl, normal electrolytes, serum calcium 8.8 mg/dl, serum phosphorus 4.9 mg/dl, random urine protein 292 mg/dl, random urine creatinine 49 mg/dl, urine protein/creatinine ratio of 5.9, hemoglobin A1c 7% and hemoglobin 13.9 g/dl. Patient was educated about the course and prognosis of his kidney disease and advised diet and exercise for weight loss. He was referred for arterial-venous fistula placement for providing renal replacement therapy in future. Over the next 6 months the patient failed all conservative methods of weight loss including the use of orlistat. His morbid obesity posed a major contraindication for enrolling him for kidney transplantation. He agreed to the surgical therapy option for treating his obesity. He was referred for bariatric surgery in June 2003.
After the bariatric surgery in September 2003, he had lost 60 pounds at 6 months (BMI 37). He was able to discontinue all his oral hypoglycemic agents maintaining a hemoglobin A1c of 6.2% and required only one anti-hypertensive medication to achieve the recommended target blood pressure reading. His BUN and creatinine has remained at 22 mg/dl and 4.6 mg/dl respectively. The patient is being followed at regular intervals and over the course of the next eight months has lost an additional 30 pounds (BMI 32), a total weight loss of 90 pounds since the bariatric surgery. His serum creatinine has remained stable at 4 mg/dl, BUN 37 mg/dl, random urinary protein 99 mg/dl, random urinary creatinine 121 mg/dl, urine protein/creatinine ratio of 0.8 and hemoglobin A1c 5.1%. The inverse creatinine to time plot as shown in figure clearly demonstrates the stabilization of the renal function 15 months following his weight loss surgery. The patient was being evaluated for pre-emptive renal transplantation and because of his previous history of coronary artery disease he underwent a left heart catheterization study in March 2005. Unfortunately, despite all precautions he developed radio-contrast induced nephropathy and had to be initiated on renal replacement therapy. He currently remains on dialysis and is awaiting a renal transplantation, which would not have been possible without his weight loss."
58,315313,533123,984004,"A 13 years old boy with Behçet's disease was referred to our hospital with chills, fever, cough, and chest pain of one month duration in June 2001. The diagnosis of Behçet's disease was established 4 years prior to this admission, that had presented with oral aphtae, orchitis, right eye uveitis leading to blindness, recurrent pseudofolliculitis, knee arthritis, and lower extremity deep vein thrombosis, all attributable to this autoimmune disorder. He had been treated by Prednisolone (15 mg/day) and Methotrexate (7.5 mg/week) for last 7 month.
Physical examination revealed III/VI to-and-fro murmur along the left sternal border and an S3 gallop. The posterior-anterior chest X-ray (Fig. ), computed tomography scan with intravenous contrast media at the level of T5–T8 (Fig. ), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Fig. ), coronary angiography and echocardiography all revealed a 10.1 × 14.8 cm left ventricular pseudoaneurysm in the anterior wall of left ventricle. There was no narrowing suggesting coronary artery disease in his coronary angiography. In two-dimensional echocardiography, the typical features of pseudoaneurysm was noted including a relatively narrow neck in comparison with the diameter of the aneurysm, sharp discontinuity of the endocardium at the site at which the aneurysm communicates with the left ventricle, no noticeable valvular dysfunction, and left ventricular wall motion abnormalities. The orifice to radius ratio was not measurable due to the large size of pseudoaneurysm.
At surgery, the ostium (arrowhead in Fig. ) was measured 2.5 × 3.0 cm. The above mentioned results warranted a surgery with median sternotomy approach. After pericardotomy, a pulsatile mass appeared at the tip of left ventricle with a fistula to the heart. The pseudoaneurysm and large amounts of thrombus within it were resected, and the defect in the left ventricular wall was repaired by Teflon Plegeted Prolen 4/0. The patient made an uneventful recovery. The pathologic examination revealed a fibrous pseudoaneurysm including areas of old hemorrhage and thrombosis and chronic inflammation. There was no complication for next 24 months follow up period after the operation."
59,319919,230076,131533,"A 51-year-old postmenopausal non-Hispanic white woman was treated for a hypertensive crisis at a regional medical center in eastern Arizona. She had complained of symptoms for one week prior to admission, including light-headedness, headaches, and high blood pressure by self-measurement. Ten days prior to admission, the patient had been enrolled in a university-sponsored research trial designed to investigate the extent to which vitamin C and soy isoflavones, as supplements to a habitual diet, could provide antioxidant effects by reducing in vivo oxidative damage to cells, either alone or synergistically. During trial screening the patient reported typically consuming soy or soy products twice a week; no regular alcohol consumption; no history of hypertension or cardiovascular disease (although there was a family history of mild hypertension); no current medical supervision or care for any chronic health problems; no current use of over-the-counter or prescription medications and a routine exercise pattern of three times a week for 30–60 minutes. The participant weighed 175 pounds (79.5 kg), stood 5'8"" (1.73 m), with a body mass index of 26.7 kg/m2.
Early in the research trial, the patient was randomized to receive 500 mg vitamin C plus 5 mg/kg body weight soy isoflavones. On trial day 3, the patient reported to the investigators that she felt ""odd"" and ""light-headed."" At the time, this was not attributed to the study-related supplements because the participant reported experiencing infrequent headaches for the past 20 years. On trial days 6 and 7 of the treatment period, the participant had her blood pressure checked by an automated machine; the readings were in the range of 140–150/92–98 mmHg vs. her usual BP of 120/82 mmHg. Due to this unexpected occurrence, the investigators requested that she stop consuming the supplements and drop out of the study. The incident was reported the university's Institutional Review Board Research Compliance Office, and the research trial was allowed to continue. Unbeknownst to the investigators, the participant chose to ignore the request to discontinue the supplements and continued to take the supplements on trial days 8 and 9. On trial day 9 she found her BP to be 159/110 mmHg. That night, she experienced an intense headache, a feeling of anxiety, and difficulty sleeping. Around midday on trial day 10, she stopped by a regional medical center to have her BP checked by a medical professional before going hiking. At that time, her BP was 226/117 mmHg; she reported that ""my head feels like it is going to explode"" and she was admitted to the emergency room. Laboratory analyses, including a complete blood count, metabolic panel and thyroid stimulating hormone test, were all within normal limits. A CT scan of the head showed no abnormalities or intracranial hemorrhages and a 12 lead EKG showed a normal sinus rhythm. At this time, the participant reported to the physician a 20-year history of chronic headaches that had resolved with better sleep habits and a higher fluid intake. The participant was then given 20 mg of the alpha1 and beta-blocker labetalol HCl via intravenous infusion (see Table ). Subsequent to administration of the medication, the participant's blood pressure slowly dropped below critical levels, but did not reach normal limits. She was dismissed from the emergency room after 3 1/2 hours with a prescription for the non-selective beta-blocker propranolol HCl (Inderal LA), 80 mg once a day. She was told to discontinue the supplements that she was taking for the research trial.
The patient notified the trial investigator of the hypertensive event several days later. The hypertensive crisis was reported to the university's Institutional Review Board Research Compliance Office, and the research trial was allowed to continue with the stipulation that all participants submit to blood pressure monitoring weekly. Later that week, the participant's BP was measured by the primary investigator's staff and was still above normal limits. When the participant saw a cardiologist and her regular physician for further follow-up, no abnormalities in cardiac function, renal function or hormone levels were identified that could have led to the hypertensive crisis. The participant continued on antihypertensive medications for the next 12 months and was gradually able to decrease the dose of the medications over time."
60,319919,401569,996589,"A 54-year-old male, alcohol and tobacco user, was admitted with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus associated with the clinical symptoms of high-grade dysphagia and weight loss of 20 kg. Routine staging was done by computerized tomography (CT)-scan of the thorax and abdomen, ultrasonography, positron emission tomography (PET) scan, esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy and bronchoscopy. Functional evaluation was done by electrocardiogram (ECG), cardiac ultrasonography and spiroergometry.
The CT-scan of the thorax and the mediastinum showed a tumor of the middle third of the esophagus with a suspicion of tumor infiltration of the thoracic aorta and the left main bronchus. However, infiltration of the main bronchus could be excluded by bronchoscopy. Infiltration of the thoracic aorta could also be excluded by MRI-angiography. The CT-scan of the abdomen and the abdominal ultrasound showed no signs of tumor spread. The PET-scan demonstrated a pathological tracer uptake at the level of the middle third of the esophagus with no signs of distal metastasis. Esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy showed a tumor stenosis of 7 cm length, from 30 to 37 cm, and a diameter of 4 – 6 mm, further there was an intraluminal obstruction about more than 50 % which was additional confirmed by an esophagogram.
Transthoracic esophagectomy and 2-field lymphadenectomy was carried out as reported in literature [,]. Intraoperative frozen section showed no residual tumor at the lateral, distal and proximal margins. The mediastinal lymph nodes showed no signs of tumor infiltration. Reconstruction was done by orthotopic gastric pull-up and hand-sewn side to end collar esophago-gastrostomy. In order to perform postoperative early feeding a naso-jejunal catheter was introduced and placed distal to the duodeno-jejunal fold.
During the digital placement of the naso-jejunal feeding catheter a submucosal jejunal nodule with a diameter of 1 cm was detected about 40 cm distal to the duodeno-jejunal fold. The nodule was completely resected by jejunotomy. Intraoperative frozen section showed a submucosal metastasis of the esophagus. Further evaluation of the small intestine and the complete abdominal cavity showed no signs of metastasis.
Finally histopathological work-up of the specimens confirmed the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus (Figure ) and a solitary submucosal jejunal metastasis. Furthermore, the submucosal jejunal metastasis was associated with local submucosal venous and lymphatic infiltration (Figure ). In immunhistochemical tests the tumor cells showed reaction to CEA and CK 5–6. The definitive staging was T3, N0, M1, L1, G3, R0.
The further course of the patient was uneventful and he could be discharged on the 14th postoperative day. As this was stage IV squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus adjuvant chemotherapy was not offered to the patient []. However, a follow-up protocol was initiated with CT-scans every 3-month for the first year."
61,320742,815465,533564,"A 70-year-old gentleman presented with a two-month history of bleeding per rectum and altered bowel habits. There was no history of tenesmus but sensation of incomplete evacuation following defecation as well as a feeling of a lump in the anal canal was present. His appetite and weight had been stable.
Clinically he looked well and abdominal examination revealed no abnormality. Per rectal examination revealed a mass in the posterior wall of the rectum with intact mucosa, which had significantly narrowed the lumen. Colonoscopy revealed the presence of a mass in the posterolateral wall of the rectum extending from 4 to 14 cm from the anal verge, with normal overlying mucosa. In addition, there was also a large sessile polyp in the descending colon and an ulceroproliferative growth at the splenic flexure; histopathology confirmed adenomatous polyp and adenocarcinoma respectively.
Computerised tomography (CT) of the pelvis showed thickening of the distal rectum with an obvious low density poorly enhancing lesion with possible calcification in its wall. Tissue plane between this lesion and prostate was not clearly seen but there was no infiltration of the ischiorectal fat (Figure ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a very large well-defined mass in the left presacral / ischio-anal fossa contiguous with rectal wall and thus almost certainly arising from one of the elements of the rectal wall (Figure ). Barium enema showed an apple core lesion in the splenic flexure (Figure ) as well as narrowing of the distal rectal lumen (Figure ).
The case was fully discussed at the colorectal multidisciplinary team meeting and all the surgical options including left hemicolectomy combined with rectosigmoidectomy plus transverse colostomy were fully evaluated. However, the consensus was that the additional presence of an adenocarcinoma as well as an adenoma higher up in the colon combined with the size of rectal schwannoma (12 cms) made panproctocolectomy with permanent ileostomy the best viable option. Furthermore, this was also the preferred choice of the patient as he opted to have an ileostomy rather than a colostomy. Surgery was performed without complications and the postoperative recovery was uneventful. At 6 months follow-up, the patient remains asymptomatic.
Macroscopic examination of the resected specimen confirmed the malignant tumour in the splenic flexure, the polyp in the descending colon and a 10 × 12 cm tumour with a well-defined pseudocapsule in the postero-lateral wall of the mid and low rectum (Figure ). The surface of the latter lesion was fusiform with bluish-grey colour and its cut surface was irregularly lobulated with occasional cystic and necrotic areas.
Histopathology of the splenic flexure lesion showed an invasive moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma (G1; Dukes B; Stage2). The polyp further down the colon was a tubulovillous adenoma with moderate focal dysplasia. The rectal tumour showed irregularly running fascicles of spindly to plump mesenchymal cells. The tumour was fairly vascularised with presence of a number of dilated and engorged vessels. The mitotic count was 4 per high power field. Some parts of the tumour were quite cellular while few areas were hypocellular reminiscent of the Antoni A and Antoni B patterns respectively (Figures and ). Immunostaining revealed strong reactivity for neuron specific enolase (NSE), vimentin, CD34 and focal positivity for S100 (Figures and ). Smooth muscle markers actin and desmin were negative."
62,320742,920632,378809,"A 67-year-old man with past history of Ivor Lewis esophagectomy 6 years previously for a Barrett's esophagus presented with dysphagia, recurrent cough, regurgitation and weight-loss. Endoscopy suggested a benign anastomotic stricture, for which he underwent dilatation. However his symptoms worsened and he continued to lose weight in spite of supervised dietary therapy. Aspiration was suspected and a barium swallow was performed. This demonstrated pharyngeal in-coordination, as the probable cause of aspiration. A repeat endoscopy was non-contributory. A feeding jejunostomy was inserted to prevent continued weight loss. In spite of this, he continued to have repeated chest infections resulting in extensive bronchiectatic changes in the right lower lobe.
A tracheostomy was planned at this stage to prevent aspiration. Whilst he was being intubated for the procedure, air was noted to escape from the right bronchus. A bronchoscopy revealed the presence of the GBF, with the bronchial opening in the right main stem bronchus located about 1 cm below the tracheal bifurcation and the gastric opening midway down the lesser curvature of the gastric conduit. The temporal sequence of events suggests that fistulation had occurred at the time of anastomotic dilatation, and thus the worsening of symptoms following the procedure. The fistula was however, difficult to diagnose in spite of extensive investigations leading to unexpected finding in the anaesthetic room.
Given his debilitated condition and poor respiratory function stenting was considered to occlude the fistula. However as the fistula was positioned in the middle of the gastric conduit (Figure ) it was not deemed amenable to stenting due to poor fixation of the stent and risk of migration. And similarly satisfactory stenting of right main stem bronchus was difficult to achieve due to short length of this bronchus and consequent tendency to migrate. Though associated with greater risk of morbidity and mortality, a surgical approach was deemed the best approach for this problem.
At operation a right-sided re-thoracotomy was performed and careful dissection carried out to display the anatomy of the GBF (Figure ). The fistula was excised with a cuff of healthy gastric conduit and bronchial tissue. The gastric and bronchial openings were closed directly with absorbable stitches with interposition of bovine pericardium in between the two suture lines. The patient made an uneventful recovery from operation. A contrast study one-week later confirmed absence of leakage from the gastric conduit and feeding was started. Histopathological examination confirmed the presence of benign GBF in the resected specimen.
The patient was discharged home after two weeks and remains well six months later."
63,331827,104920,393183,"A 62-year-old male presented with shortness of breath for one week. He had a smoking history of 10 pack-years [1 pack per day, per year, for 10 years]. The X-ray chest revealed a large pleural effusion with suggestion of a mass in the right upper lobe of lung (RUL) with massive hilar lymphadenopathy. The left lung parenchyma was normal and the pulmonary vasculature was not congested. A computerized tomography scan of the chest confirmed a mass in RUL.
Clinically, the tumor was considered as lung primary and pulmonary consult was requested. Bronchoscopy of RUL revealed an irregular friable mucosa. A transbronchial FNAB of the RUL mass was performed with other evaluations.
The patient had previous history of GBM in the right occipital area 13 months ago for which he underwent initial surgical excision with radiation therapy and systemic chemotherapy. The tumor recurred after 6 months for which he underwent extensive debulking and placement of gliadel wafers (BNCU-impregnated wafers)."
64,331827,629818,305542,"A 29-year-old woman from Kumba, Cameroon, was admitted in January 2004 to St. John's Hospital and Maternity, Kumba, with a five-day history of fever, emesis, poorly localized abdominal discomfort, myalgias and hepatosplenomegaly. Her total leukocyte count was 1.7 × 109/l, (neutrophils 51%, lymphocytes 43%, monocytes 5%). Urinalysis was normal and thin and thick film examinations of the peripheral blood were negative for malaria. The patient also tested negative for HIV. A blood Widal test however, showed a titre of 80 against ""O"" (somatic) antigen and 160 against the ""H"" (flagella) antigen of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi (recommended cut-off titre in our hospital: ≥ 1:80 and ≥ 1:160 for the ""O"" and ""H"" antigens respectively). Blood culture grew Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi. Two months prior to her illness, she had suffered from an attack of suspected typhoid fever and had been treated with chloramphenicol 500 mg every 6 hours for 14 days.
Antibiogram of the isolated S. enterica serovar Typhi was performed by disc diffusion techniques as recommended by NCCLS guidelines [], Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin were determined by agar dilution method []. The antibiotic discs used included ampicillin 10 μg (Beecham), co-trimoxazole 1.25/23.75 μg (Roche), chloramphenicol 30 μg (Antibioticos SA), ciprofloxacin 5 μg (Bayer), nalidixic acid 30 μg (Sigma) and ceftriaxone 30 μg (Roche). The isolate was found resistant to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, co-trimoxazole and chloramphenicol, but susceptible to ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin by disc diffusion test. The MICs of ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid were 0.5 μg/ml and 32.0 μg/ml respectively. The patient remained febrile after 7 days of oral administration of 500 mg ciprofloxacin every 12 hours. Thereafter, the patient was administered 1 g ceftriaxone every 12 hours intravenously, which rendered her afebrile within four days. Treatment was continued for another 3 days. The patient did not relapse on follow-up."
65,361166,847569,753031,"A 4.9 × 3.1 cm peritracheal posterior mediastinal mass was incidentally discovered on a computed tomography (CT) scan of a 51 year-old gentleman status-post left hemicolectomy in October 2003 for a T3N1Mx, stage III colon cancer. He had moderate gastroesophageal reflux and mild dysphagia. A barium swallow revealed compression and displacement of the proximal thoracic esophagus. Esophageal mucosal ulcerations were not observed. Integrated positron emission tomography(PET)/CT scan using fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) showed no uptake in the lesion. Due to the benign clinical features of the mass, the differential diagnosis included benign neoplasms such as a leiomyoma or a benign thyroid neoplasm. The possibility of lymphadenopathy secondary to metastatic adenocarcinoma was remote. Endoscopic ultrasound was performed using the UC-30P (Olympus, America, Melville, NY) and revealed a 52- × 39-mm hypoechoic, well-circumscribed posterior mediastinal mass in the thoracic inlet approximately 22 cm from the incisor (Figure ). After using color Doppler ultrasound, EUS-FNA of the mediastinal mass was performed. Adequate material was obtained for on-site rapid cytopathologic interpretation. The patient underwent a posterior-lateral thoracotomy with entry over the fourth rib. A firm, fixed mass in the posterior mediastinum near the esophagus entering the base of the neck was identified. A 4.0 × 2.8 × 2.5 cm well-circumscribed soft tissue mass was completely resected."
66,361166,959192,125824,"A 52 year-old male presented to our institution having undergone local excision of a left breast tumor one month previously. The tumor had measured 7 × 5 cm. The mass had been present for 10 years. At physical examination there was evidence of recent surgery and the patient had a 1 cm ipsilateral axillary lymph node. Serum tumor markers and other routine blood test were normal. The liver ultrasonography, chest X-ray and bone scan were negative for metastases.
He underwent a modified radical mastectomy. Residual tumor measuring 2.8 cm × 2.6 cm was present. On macroscopic examination the tumor was firm and circumscribed (Figure ). Microscopy showed the classical features of secretory carcinoma with a microcystic pattern (Figure ) with abundant intra and extracellular secretory material. No tumor was present at the surgical margins. Colloidal iron staining highlighted the secretory material (Figure ). On immunohistochemistry, the tumor cells were positive for S-100 protein (Figure ) but negative for estrogen and progesterone receptor and HER2 (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). 2 of 24 resected lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma.
The case was investigated for the t(12;15) ETV6-NTRK3 translocation using two complementary probe sets []. A t(12;15) translocation fusion probe assay (Fig. ) and a chromosome 15 NTRK3 gene split-apart assay (Fig. ) were used to detect the t(12;15) translocation. All BAC clones used in this study were obtained from the BACPAC Resources Centre at the Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute. All probes were labeled by nick translation with the use of the manufacturer's recommended protocol (Vysis, Downer's Grove, Illinois). BAC clones RP11-434C1 and RP11-407P10 telomeric to ETV6 on 12p were labeled with spectrum orange. On chromosome 15, RP11-114I9 and RP11-730G13, centromeric to NTRK3 on 15q were labeled with spectrum green and clone RP11-247E14, telomeric to NTRK3 was labeled with spectrum orange. Six-micrometer tissue sections were baked overnight at 60C and then subjected to FISH with a modified protocol (Vysis, Downers Grove, IL) []. FISH signals were analyzed with a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescent microscope equipped with a COHU-CCD camera. Images were captures with Metasystems ISIS software (MetaSystems Group Inc., Belmont MA) with seven focal planes stacked for the analysis.
In view of the nodal metastasis it was decided to treat the patient with six courses of adjuvant 5-fluorouracil, adriamycin and cyclophosphamide (FAC). The patient abandoned treatment after the second course. The patient returned to clinic eighteen months later with two hard nodules in the surgical resection area measuring 8 × 8 cm and 4 cm × 4 cm, (one ulcerated), and three left axillary subcutaneous nodules, two measuring 2 × 2 cm and one 3 × 3 cm (Figure ).
A chest CT scan identified pulmonary metastases with a right pleural effusion (Fig. ). The effusion was drained via percutaneous thoracentesis. He then began treatment with concurrent radiation (total dose of 60 Gy) and UFT (Tegafur-Uracil) to the chest followed by systemic UFT as a single agent for 3 months. Post-treatment, there was no change in the pulmonary disease and there was minor response of chest-wall and axillary disease (Figure and )."
67,383077,155958,256573,"A 40-year old female patient was referred to our emergency department because of an intended overdose with 200 mg diazepam, 400 mg temazepam, and 2250 mg sertraline.
Her main complaints were fatigue and drowsiness. Blood pressure, pulse rate, and auscultation of the heart and lungs were normal. The patient was treated with sodiumsulfate and charcoal and was admitted to the intensive care unit for continuous control of vital signs. Routine laboratory studies (hematology, chemistry) were normal. Plasma levels of diazepam and temazepam were elevated, 1155 ugr/l (normal: 125 – 750 ugr/l) and 1710 ugr/l (normal: 300–900 ugr/l, respectively). Plasma levels of sertraline and desmethylsertraline were 174 ug/l (normal 20–55 ug/l []) and 276 ng/l, respectively.
Her ECG upon admission (upper panel of the figure) shows a sinus rhythm (77 b.p.m.) without conduction disturbances. QT interval in lead V2 was 370 ms. We used the Bazett method (QT time divided by the square root of the RR interval) to calculate the corrected QT (QTc). QTc at admission was 420 ms and negative T-waves were found in leads V1–V3. A second ECG, taken one day after admission (lower panel of the figure), showed a markedly prolonged QT interval with deepened negative T waves in leads V1–V3. QT interval was 520 ms in V2, at a heart rate (HR) of 63 b.p.m (QTc 525 ms). An old ECG (august 2002) showed a sinus rhythm with a HR of 63 b.p.m and a QT interval in lead V2 of 370 ms (QTc 373 ms; ECG not shown).
After 4 days the patient was discharged to a psychiatric hospital because the risk for another suicide attempt was deemed high by the psychiatric consultant. After discharge, the patient underwent further out-patient cardiac evaluation. Echocardiography revealed no structural heart disease. On exercise electrocardiography, patient reached 88% of her maximum HR – no abnormal ST-segment changes were observed. Hereafter, the use of sertraline was resumed in a dose of 50 mg twice daily under guidance of her psychiatrist. Control ECG revealed a normal QT interval (not shown)."
68,383077,720132,853063,"A 17-year-old girl was admitted to the local gynaecology unit with recurrent abdominal cramps, nausea and vomiting. She had a history of repeated episodes of abdominal pain in the past. The symptoms had begun some years earlier, causing several hospitalizations and two laparoscopic interventions.
Medical history revealed allergic coryza and neurodermatitis, but no food allergy. No other diseases were reported.
Laboratory rendered a high white blood cell count (WBC) 13.300 × 109/liter with an eosinophil count of 58% and CRP 5.2 mg/l. Laparoscopy showed a large amount of ascites and swollen intraabdominal lymph nodes. Thus, screening for tuberculosis was initiated. A chest x-ray showed no signs of pulmonary disease, Mantoux test and all cultures remained negative. However, one pcr from ascites was positive and the diagnosis of intestinal tuberculosis was established. The patient was started on rifampicin, isoniazid, ethambutol and pyrazinamide. Despite treatment symptoms persisted for the following six month.
On admission the patient was still under therapy with rifampicin and isoniazid. Physical examination demonstrated diffuse abdominal tenderness without peritoneal signs. The WBC was 13100 × 109/liter with an eosinophilic count of 53 %, total IgE 1870 kU/l and CRP 32 mg/l. Clinical and laboratory indices for autoimmune disease were absent. Abdominal ultrasound and computed tomography showed ubiquitous ascites and thickening of the wall of the lower oesophagus, stomach and bowel (Fig. ). The patient developed severe abdominal pain, only controlled by opoid analgesia. An iliac crest biopsy showed an eosinophilic count over 40 percent but no signs of leukaemia. Again the ascitic fluid rendered a high eosinophilic count. Blood tests as well as stool cultures and microscopy for ova and parasites were negative. Endoscopy of the upper intestinum and the colon showed no abnormalities of the intestinal mucosa. Remarkably biopsies from oesophagus, stomach, ileum and colon yielded distinct eosinophilic infiltrations reaching the lamina propria which finally lead to the diagnosis of a primary eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorder (Fig. ).
Thus, this patient fulfilled all diagnostic criteria for eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Since active tuberculosis was ruled out we stopped anti-mycobacterial treatment.
The patient was switched to 40 mg prednisone per day. Symptoms were alleviated quickly in the beginning. The patient was set on a taper. Reaching a dose of 10 mg a day symptoms started again. Therefore the dose was doubled and Montelukast 10 mg/d was started. The symptoms resolved within days and the prednisone could be tapered within six weeks. Currently, the patient remains completely off steroids. She has been symptom free for the last 24 months under Montelukast. Regular physical examinations and blood tests have shown normal results."
69,384335,301142,3840,"A 66-year-old man was referred with a diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism, mild renal failure, peptic ulcer and large suspicious cervico-mediastinal goitre. The patient had fatigue, anaemia, anorexia and bone pain for several months. The fine needle aspiration of the neck mass, performed before the admission showed the presence of malignant cells. Preoperative laboratory findings are reported in table .
Ultrasonography of the neck showed an enlarged thyroid gland with substernal extension; many solid nodules and some calcifications were present. The computerised tomographic (CT) scan showed a large solid mass in left neck, with extension to the mediastinum, and displacement of the trachea, oesophagus and great vessels (Figure ). Tracheobronchoscopy demonstrated substenosis of the proximal trachea due to extrinsic compression.
Tc-99m sestamibi scintigraphy demonstrated diffuse radiopharmaceutical uptake within the thyroid region and the lower portion of the neck. This tracer accumulation corresponded to the mass and it was persistent during the different phases of the scintigraphy without significant changes (Figure ). The lack of a spot area of increased MIBI uptake ruled out the diagnosis of adenoma. The scintigraphic pattern was classified as due to a multinodular goitre.
The patient was vigorously hydrated and bisphosphonates were given preoperatively to control hypercalcemia. Eight days later the serum calcium level decreased to 10.4 mg/dl. With the above clinical findings, the patient underwent surgical neck exploration.
At surgery a voluminous cervicomediastinal firm mass was found that could not be removed via the superior thoracic strait; therefore a complete sternotomy was performed. The surgical findings revealed an ovoid, grayish-yellow, hard mass, measuring 12 × 9 × 8 cm, adherent to the base of the left lobe of the thyroid, extending to the anterior upper mediastinum; the recurrent laryngeal nerve was laterally displaced but not invaded. Therefore en bloc resection of the mass along with the total thyroid gland and the connective tissue apparently involved in the tumour was performed. All the lymphoid tissue from the ipsilateral tracheoesophageal groove to the upper mediastinum was removed
The histological report described a parenchymatous thyroid gland, with a subcapsular gelatinous nodule (1 cm diameter). The voluminous tumour adherent to the base of left lobe was multinodular, greyish-yellow. Histologically many fibrous bands of acellular collagenous tissue extending from the thickened capsule, subdivided the neoplasm into irregular compartments. The tumour cells, arranged in trabecular and solid sheets, were homogeneous; they showed round – ovoid nuclei, with evident nucleoli, and clear cytoplasm; occasionally cytoplasm was abundant, eosinophilic and granular; nuclei were pleomorphic; mitoses were present (3 per 10 HPF). Rare multinucleated osteoclastic-like giant cells were found around foci of haemorrhage; necrosis and coarse calcifications were observed. Both capsular and vascular invasion were present at the periphery of neoplasm. In the infiltrated adjacent adipose tissue, well-circumscribed, encapsulated nodules of tumour, with a peripheral rim of lymphoid tissue were found; they were considered to be metastatic lymph nodes. Final diagnosis was a parathyroid carcinoma (Figure ). The postoperative course was complicated by transient oligouria, with worsening the chronic renal failure.
The patient also had severe postoperative hypocalcaemia, necessitating calcium and vitamin D therapy. The postoperative laboratory values at hospital discharge are shown in table . Figure shows the change of serum Calcium and PTH levels during patient's hospitalization
At follow-up, three, six, nine and 12 months after surgery, the patient was disease-free with normal levels of PTH and calcaemia and improvement of the bone disease symptoms. Whole body positron emission tomography (PET) performed one year after surgery was negative."
70,384335,795991,336142,"A 76 year old man was refferd from a District Hospital for further treatment of a tumor in retro-peritoneal space, originating from the left adrenal gland.
The patient was admitted to the District Hospital for investigation of macroscopic haematuria and lumbar pain during the last 48 hours. He had a past medical history of hypertension and hepatitis B. The laboratory investigations revealed hypercalcaemia and in an abdominal ultrasound scan (US), a mass was detected in the retroperitoneal space close to the left kidney. Then a Computed Tomography (CT) scan with contrast was performed which revealed an enhancing mass, 10 cm in diameter, between the pancreas and the left kidney originating from the left adrenal gland. No other pathological findings from intra or extra-peritoneal organs were identified (Figure ). The serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) concentration was 75.6 ng/ml (normal range: 0–10 ng/ml) and C19-9 concentration 37.6 ng/ml, while the liver function tests were normal.
After his admission to our Department, the patient was tested for underlying hormonally active tumor by low dose (1 mg) overnight dexamethasone suppression test and a 24-hour urine collection for catecholamines, cortisol, 17-ketosteroids, metanephrines and vanillylmandelic acid. As the patient was hypertensive, plasma aldosterone and plasma rennin were also tested. None of the tests indicated a functional adrenal tumor. The patient was under surveillance due to hepatitis B and had been subjected to AFP measurement and US scan 2, 8 and 14 months prior to his admission (AFP: 65, 69 and 60 ng/ml respectively). Regarding the facts that there was not remarkable increase in the AFP level during the last 14 months, the multiple US scans were negative and the CT scan on admission did not reveal any intrahepatic lesion, HCC was not considered in our patient.
With a presumptive diagnosis of a non-functional adrenal tumor, the patient underwent left adrenalectomy through a left Köcher incision. The exploration of the other intra-peritoneal organs did not reveal any other palpable lesions while the liver was found to be cirrhotic during the operation. The resected lesion was a firm elastic mass measuring 11.5 cm by 7.5 cm (Figure ). The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on day 7. Histologically, the resected lesion was a poorly differentiated metastatic HCC with trabecullar patterns. The patient was then informed of the findings and contacted for readmission, further investigation and adjuvant therapy. However, despite our repeated attempts, the patient refused to be subjected to any further investigation or treatment.
Seven months later patient presented with cachexia, icterus, abdominal discomfort and significant weight loss (more than 10 % of body weight). The serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) concentration was 1620.5 ng/ml and the serum bilirubin 5.4 mg/dL. CT scan revealed hyperdense lesions of the liver (Figure ). Even though Trans-Arterial Embolization (TAE) was then performed, the serum AFP concentration showed persistently elevation to 3543 ng/ml one month later, and the patient died 3 months after readmission due to rapidly progressive liver failure."
71,400396,473161,184895,"A 68-year-old man was admitted in January 2004 for a macroscopic hematuria. The patient had no relevant past medical or family history, and laboratory data were all within normal limits. A cystoscopic examination was performed and a transurethral resection of a tiny, sessile polypoid lesion of the bladder neck was carried out. Clinical evaluation included ultrasonography and computerized tomography (CT) scan. The patients was seen at last follow-up 14 months after diagnosis and he was completely negative.
Grossly, the tumor was a well-circumscribed, small ovoid nodule of 0.4 cm in diameter. Histologically a polypoid tumor appeared to be covered by slightly attenuated normal urothelium. The tumor filled-up the lamina propria showing a predominantly glandular arrangement (Fig ), with scanty anastomosing cords of cuboidal cells with fairly regular nuclei. Foci of von Brunn nests were seen at the periphery near the urothelium (Fig ). Mitoses and necrosis were not seen. A panel of immunostains, including antibodies against keratin 7, βHCG, chromogranin, synaptophysin, S-100 protein, NSE, serotonin, calcitonin, TTF-1, progesteron, and p53 protein was applied to representative sections of the tumor using the avidin-biotin complex technique (tab ).
Immunohistochemically the tumor strongly reacted with synaptophysin (Fig ), chromogranin (Fig ), calcitonin (Fig ), keratin 7 (Fig ), and NSE. βHCG was positive in about 10% of the neoplastic cells. p53 protein, progesteron, S-100 protein, serotonin and TTF-1 were negative."
72,400396,306201,365759,"J.R. was a 3210 gram child born to a 21-year-old gravida 1, para 1 mother by vaginal delivery at 36 weeks of gestation. The mother received appropriate prenatal care and the pregnancy was uncomplicated. There was no gestational history of tobacco, alcohol, illicit substance or medication use. A cardiac echogenic focus and possible anatomic heart defect was noted on routine prenatal ultrasound examination and the child was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit for management at birth. A thoracic echocardiogram showed mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis and coarctation of the aorta. Surgical repair of the coarctation was conducted. A right diaphragmatic eventration was simultaneously repaired. During this initial hospitalization no cardiac arrhythmias were monitored on telemetry. Due to the structural heart defects a chromosome analysis including fluorescence in situ hybridization for both DiGeorge loci was performed and revealed no abnormalities. A diagnosis of Kabuki syndrome was made by two independent geneticists based on phenotypic features. Clinical features in this child consistent with the diagnosis of Kabuki syndrome included arched eyebrows with sparse hair laterally, eversion of the lateral lower eyelid, a cleft palate, bifid uvula, broad nasal root with depressed nasal tip, and persistent fetal finger tip pads with otherwise normal dermatoglyphics. Neuroimaging revealed severe corpus callosum hypoplasia and ophthalmologic examination showed optic nerve atrophy bilaterally. Congenital hypothyroidism was also detected. Further cytogenetic analysis using telomere probes was conducted without detection of abnormalities.
The subsequent hospital course was complicated by numerous infections secondary to hypogammaglobulinemia and he was finally discharged to home at 3 months of age. After one week at home, he was noted to be cyanotic and non-responsive and was re-admitted to the hospital where the patient was considered to be septic and placed on broad spectrum antibiotics.
At 6.5 months of age, he was admitted to the hospital with a urinary tract infection. Sinus bradyarrythmia was recorded associated with hypoxemia with prolonged pauses progressing to asystole. Resuscitation with epinephrine was successful. Bronchoscopy was performed and showed normal airways. A cardiac echocardiogram showed diastolic dysfunction. He was started on supplemental O2 at 1/8 L by nasal canula and received furosemide, aldactazide and verapamil. No other episodes of cardiac rhythm disturbance were noted on telemetry during the remaining hospital stay.
At 9 months of age, he was admitted to the hospital in respiratory distress. He was ventilated mechanically and monitored in the ICU. While on cardiac monitoring he developed a tachyarrhythmia without 1:1 conduction then prolongation of the QT interval followed by an idioventricular rhythm which slowed to asystole. External pacing failed. After alternate doses of epinephrine and atropine the patient returned to sinus rhythm. Thoracic echocardiogram showed normal ventricular function with normal velocities across inlet and outlet valves. Troponin levels remained less than 1 and there was no other evidence of ischemia. Because of the previous episodes of bradyarrythmia, a dual chamber epicardial pacemaker was placed without complications. His ventricular and diastolic function normalized and diuretics were discontinued. He remained hemodynamically stable but continued hospitalization was required for various nosocomial infections. The family elected to make an advance directive to prevent further resuscitative efforts. Approximately one month later during hospitalization for respiratory bronchiolitis, he had another episode of bradyarrythmia which progressed to asystole and death. The pacemaker was queried and found to have functioned within normal parameters. The family consented for a limited autopsy.
The heart weighed twice the normal expected weight and there was biventricular hypertrophy, with the right ventricular wall thickness being about four times the normal thickness and the left ventricular wall thickness about twice normal (Figure ). The right atrium and the coronary sinus were dilated and the left atrium was small with endocardial fibroelastosis (Figure ). The mitral valve was stenotic, the circumference being about 3/4ths the normal circumference. The valve leaflets were thick and myxoid, and the chordae tendinae were shortened. The posterior leaflet of the mitral valve was directly inserted into the papillary muscle. There was mild aortic stenosis and the aortic valve leaflets were thick and dysplastic. The pulmonary valve circumference was about one-third greater than normal. The membranous portion of the interventricular septum was about three times the normal length and mapping of the junctional tissue revealed that the atrioventricular node was displaced caudally and the bifurcation of the Bundle of His was likewise displaced caudally (Figure ). The valve leaflet was made up of primarily mucopolysaccharide material (blue stain). The placement of the pacemaker was verified to be appropriate and dense adhesions were present between the pacer wires and the abdominal wall and bowel loops.
Postmortem pulmonary angiogram revealed severe pruning of the pulmonary vascular tree (Figure ) and absence of the background 'blush' produced by filling of intracinar arteries. Microscopic examination revealed marked luminal narrowing or fibrous occlusion of intra-acinar arteries (Figure ). In addition there was marked dilatation of lymphatics within pulmonary septa.
The patient exhibited recurrent infections requiring numerous hospitalizations. These included Klebsiella pneumonia, RSV pneumonia, Enterococcus sepsis, Candida albicans urinary tract infection, Enterobacter urosepsis, sinusitis and otitis media.
Immune evaluation revealed persistent lymphopenia; however, the percentages of T-, B-, and NK-cell subpopulations were normal (Table ). Furthermore, lymphoproliferative responses to mitogens PHA, PWM and alloantigens were normal. However, lymphoproliferative response to Concavalin A stimulation was absent. Serum IgG and IgA levels were markedly decreased, and antibody responses to tetanus toxoid and Hemophilus influenzae type B (HiB) were decreased. Following immunization with conjugated pneumococcal vaccine (Prevnar), antibody responses were decreased to 4 of 7 serotypes. Serum albumin levels were normal, and there was no evidence of protein loss through the gastrointestinal or urinary systems, and there was no evidence of chylous thorax. Thus, IVIG therapy was initiated. However, the patient shortly succumbed from cardiac arrhythmia. Autopsy revealed severe thymic involution (the thymus weighed 1 g.) and lymphoid depletion in the spleen.
Other findings included nesidioblastosis, vacuolation of the adrenal cortex, undescended testes, contraction band necrosis of the muscularis propria of the gastro-intestinal tract and growth retardation with growth parameters being < 3rd percentile."
73,403558,726891,250781,"In October 2004 a 50-year old woman was admitted presenting with gluteal and perineal fistula formation after proctocolectomy eleven years earlier. The clinical examination showed a single fistula opening on the perineum with purulent secretion. A second opening was found on the posterior wall of the vagina.
The MRI-scanning revealed a large formation in the lower pelvis reaching to the sacrum. This mass showed a thickened, contrast-enhancing wall and necrotic, liquid inner parts suggestive of abscess-formation. No involvement of the small bowel or bladder was detected (Figures , , ).
The patient's history revealed Crohn's disease first diagnosed in 1981. Ten years later (1991), the patient was readmitted because of severe perineal fistula disease. The clinical and radiological examination showed multiple transphincteric fistulas and a single rectovaginal fistula as well as one enterocutaneous fistula originating from the terminal ileum. After medical management (parenteral nutrition and corticoids) she was referred to the department of surgery where an ileocoecal resection with a diversion ileostomy and drainage of the perianal fistulas were performed. Postoperatively the patient developed all signs of an Addison crisis, which could be satisfactorily treated.
The patient was readmitted in 1993 with a new inflammatory episode including perianal fistulating disease. Because of the disease recurrence and due to further impairment of the sphincter mechanism a proctocolectomy with exstirpation of the sphincter ani muscles and a terminal ileostomy was recommended and performed. The histopathological examination showed signs of Crohn's disease with some epitheloid cell granulomas and giant cells as well as microgranulomas in both the large bowel and the rectum. No signs of malignancy and no dysplastic changes were found. The patient developed a paralytic ileus that could be treated conservatively and a perianal wound infection which required secondary wound closure.
Three years later, in 1996, the patient was readmitted because of a persistent perineal secretion. No fistulas and no signs of Crohn's disease could be found in the small bowel. The patient was treated with local wound therapy without any further surgical procedure until readmission in 2004.
After informed consent a perineal drainage with entire resection of the clinically inflamed tissue was performed. Intraoperatively the tissue showed a colloidal consistency and fistulation into the coccygeal bone and the vagina. Histological analysis of the tissue detected a mucinous adenocarcinoma occupying the resected tissue and the resection margins. The tumour consisted of moderately atypical glandular cell elements lying in pools of PAS-positive mucin. A distinct fibroblastic stromal reaction could be found in the surrounding mesenchyma.
Upon diagnosis, a second intervention was performed including an en-bloc exenteration of the uterus, vagina and ovaries via laparotomy and resection of the sacrum through a posterior approach. The pelvis was closed using a Vypro® mesh (polypropylene-polygalactine composite) and the perineum was left open for secondary wound healing.
Postoperatively, bladder function was impaired, otherwise the patient recovered well and could be dismissed into out patient oncological care.
Examination of the specimen showed typical cylindrical epithelium of colorectal type lining some residual lumina of fistulas and cysts (Figure ). The resection margins did not show any residual fistulas. No rests of original bowel mucosa or remaining bowel wall structures could be found in the ""en-bloc"" specimen. But there were some minor residual carcinomatous infiltrates in the soft tissues between coccygeal bone and dorsal wall of the vagina (Figure ). Bone tissue and the vaginal wall structures themselves proofed to be free of tumour histologically. No florid, ulcerating or granulomatous inflammation was found in the remaining mucosal tissues."
74,403558,145911,857818,"A previously healthy 46-year old man on no medications was diagnosed with a Clark Level 5 malignant melanoma on his left shoulder following resection of a mole under local anesthetic. The lesion was subsequently reported as a melanoma and three weeks following his resection, before he could undergo a metastatic work-up, he presented to hospital with nausea, vomiting and right upper quadrant pain. He did not appear toxic, he was afebrile, and physical examination was unremarkable but for a tender right upper quadrant and hepatomegaly. Laboratory investigations demonstrated leukocytosis, modestly elevated liver enzymes, and lactic acidosis. Computed tomography scanning revealed marked hepatomegaly with an extensive infiltrative process and ultrasound demonstrated normal bile ducts. Baseline imaging of his abdomen was planned for staging, however it was not conducted prior to his presentation to hospital.
On day two of his admission the patient deteriorated with respiratory failure requiring endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. He had oliguria, and hypotension refractory to fluid resuscitation. Rapidly progressive multi-system organ failure developed with anuria/azotemia requiring continuous renal replacement therapy. Liver failure ensued as evidenced by coagulopathy refractory to plasma infusions and by progressive transaminitis and hyperbilirubinema. He developed distributive shock requiring maximal pressor support. There were significant biochemical derangements including hyperkalemia, acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, hyperuricemia and hypocalcemia. Hemodialysis was commenced to rectify the hyperkalemia and acidosis that was refractory to continuous renal replacement therapy. An aggressive resuscitative and treatment approach was undertaken to allow confirmation that the liver lesions were melanoma and not a potentially treatable infection or lymphoma. An ultrasound guided transjugular biopsy of the liver was performed in the intensive care unit. Based on a frozen section diagnosis of malignant infiltration of the liver, high dose corticosteroid therapy was commenced. The patient continued to deteriorate despite maximal physiologic support and palliative measures were instituted after discussion with the next-of-kin. He succumbed to his illness on day-4 of admission. Autopsy revealed >80% liver infiltration by melanoma (Figure ), a diagnosis verified by an immunohistochemical phenotype of S-100 and HMB-45 positive cells (Figure )."
75,411645,342659,251652,"A 70 year old man was admitted with more than one year history of abdominal distension and a weight gain of 10 kilograms. He was evaluated in another center and was given the diagnosis of ascites associated with cirrhosis.
His past medical history was significant due to acute myocardial infarction in 1974, mild asthma and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Since his last evaluation, he has been receiving diltiazem 180 mg/day, aspirin 100 mg/day, digoxin 0,750 mg/week and spironalactone 50 mg/day. He is asymptomatic and walks 2000–3000 meters a day without angor or dyspnea.
The physical examination shows moderate abdominal distension, with no hepatosplenomegaly or edema, and there is mild jugular vein distension (1/3). The hepatojugular reflux was negative. His blood pressure is 130/70 mmHg, pulse 70/ min and regular. The cardiac auscultation is normal and his lungs are clear. His current weight is 78.8 kg. One year before this admission he weighted 70 kg and before starting diuretics he was weighting 81 kg.
The blood laboratory was normal, except for a slightly increase in gamma-glutamyltransferase and 5'nucleotidase (Table ). A paracentesis was performed which showed a milky fluid with a high albumin gradient showing portal hypertension (Table ), all cultures and cytological studies were negative. Other studies showed normal iron values; antiHIV, HBsAg, antiHBs, antiHBc IgM and antiHCV negative, antiHBc IgG positive; ANA, AMA, SMA y ANCA negative.
A helical CT scan of the abdomen showed mild hepatomegaly, mild enlargement of caudate lobe and ascites. An upper endoscopy ruled out esophageal varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy. A Doppler ultrasound showed a patent portal vein, with a normal diameter (6.6 mm) without alterations in the flow. A cardiac ultrasound showed moderate to severe systolic left ventricle dysfunction with global hypokinesia and the inferolateral wall was akinesic. The left ventricle diameters were normal and the left atria was enlarged (52 mm). The estimated left ventricular ejection fraction was 35%. There were no relevant valve signs, nor mitral or tricuspid regurgitation, nor pericardial disease.
A liver biopsy showed engrossment of centrilobular veins walls and fibrosis, with centrilobular hemorrhage and marked sinusoidal dilatation in acinar zone 3, suggesting increased intrahepatic venous pressure. An angiogram showed dilated but patent suprahepatic and portal veins and inferior vena cava, with slow flow. The measure of free suprahepatic, wedge suprahepatic, pulmonary capillary wedge, pulmonary artery, right ventricle and right atrial pressures confirmed the diagnosis of portal hypertension related to heart failure (Table ). He began treatment with furosemide 40 mg/day and spironalactone 100 mg/day; he continued treatment with aspirin, digoxin and diltiazem. The patient lost 8 kg and the abdominal distension was resolved approximately 2 month after the beginning of the treatment. Given the good response to treatment we decided to withhold other possible treatments (i.e. angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors)."
76,411645,723441,471471,"A 52 years old female attended the breast clinic with a cystic mass superior to the left nipple. Clinical FNAC of this mass was performed (using a 23 gauge needle and 10 cc syringe) yielding 5 cc of straw-coloured fluid. Subsequently the patient had digital mammography. Thereafter, she complained of a difficulty in breathing and a subsequent chest X ray confirmed the presence of left-sided pneumothorax (Figures , ) which treated with per-cutaneous aspiration. The patient was admitted overnight for observation and a follow up chest X-ray showed resolution of the pneumothorax. The post-procedure mammogram showed an area of architectural distortion and irregularity in the medial aspect of the left breast which was regarded as suspicious. Three days later, this was subjected to an ultrasound guided core biopsy of the lesion and histology showed severe atypical hyperplasia. Ultrasound guided excision of the lesion was performed and the final histology showed radial scar, a 7 mm grade I infiltrating ductal carcinoma associated with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). The surgical margins were clear. The patient subsequently had a sentinel node biopsy using the dual localization technique under local anaesthesia.
Digital mammography failed to adequately demonstrate the left pectoralis major muscle due to hypoplasia (Figure ). Clinical examination confirmed the absence of the costo-sternal portion of the pectoralis major on the left side."
77,411840,412416,657419,"A 20-year-old Tunisian man with a three weeks history of dyspnoea, cough and haemoptysis was admitted. At the age of 18, he had suffered from painful oral and genital ulcerations and polyarthralgias. At that time, examination revealed bilateral papillary oedema and brain magnetic resonance imaging showed superior sagittal and left lateral thromboses. The patient was given oral prednisone at the dose of 1 mg/kg/day that was tapered gradually and colchicine 1 mg/day in addition to acenocoumarol to maintain International Normalized Ratio between 2 and 3. These medications were discontinued per the patient 7 months later which resulted in the recurrence of aphtous ulcerations and papulopustular eruptions episodes.
On physical examination the patient had fever, face and neck oedema, prominent superficial thoracic venous collaterals, and pseudofolliculitis lesions. There was evidence of penile and scrotal scarring and minor aphthae on the buccal mucosa. Blood pressure was 110/80 mm Hg and pulse rate 100/min.
As to laboratory tests, haemoglobin concentration was of 9 g/dl, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 60 mm/hr and C reactive protein concentration of 19 mg/l (normal < 2 mg/l). Renal and liver function tests were normal. Levels of serum IgG and IgM anticardiolipin, protein C, protein S, antithrombine III and total homocysteine were within the normal range. Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm tachycardia with no other abnormalities. Chest X-ray demonstrated hilar enlargement. Transthoracic and transoesophageal echocardiography showed multiple cardiac masses, one in the right atrium protruding through the tricuspid valve and two in the right ventricle (Figure – see Additional file 1). Helical computed tomography (CT) showed multiple thrombi in both right atrium and ventricle extending into the superior vena cava. There was innominate and brachiocephalic vein occlusion, it also showed bilateral pulmonary embolism and multiple pulmonary infarcts in the lower lobe of the lungs. A large (14 mm in diameter) aneurysm located in the right basal segmental arteries (Figure – see Additional file 2). We opted for a treatment based on low molecular weight heparin twice daily then oral anticoagulant, 1 gr of methyl prednisolone per day for 3 days, 1 mg/kg/day of oral, then tapered over 3 weeks and 1 g pulse cyslophosphamide monthly associated with colchicine 1 mg/day.
Two weeks later, oedema of the chest and neck has completely resolved. Thrombus size has substantially decreased. Nine months after discharge, no cardiac masses were detected by echocardiography and CT scan showed no evidence of previously mentioned thromboses with a complete disappearance of pulmonary aneurysm."
78,411840,632583,209168,"A 29-year-old Tunisian man with a two-month history of fever of unknown origin, weight loss and inspiratory thoracic pain was admitted. He had suffered from both genital and oral ulcers over five months. The initial physical examination revealed a temperature of 38°C, multiple pseudofolliculitis, oral and scrotal ulcerations. Laboratory tests on admission revealed: haemoglobin of 13 g/dl, erythrocyte sedimentation of 105 mm/hr and C reactive protein concentration of 204 mg/l. The tests looking for antiphospholipid antibodies, protein C, protein S and antithrombine III deficiencies were negative. The plasma total homocysteine level was 27 μmol/l (normal < 10 μmol/l). HLAB5 and pathergy tests were positive. Electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm tachycardia, and chest X-ray was normal. Transoesophageal echocardiography revealed a cardiac mass in the right atrium of 20/23 mm size attached into atrial septum protruding through the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle (Figure – see Additional file 3). These findings were confirmed by CT scan that also showed a partial obstruction of the terminal portion of the inferior vena cava and thrombosis of the left lobar pulmonary artery with multiple pulmonary infarcts. We started treatment with intravenous heparin then oral anticoagulant, 1 gr of methyl prednisolone per day for 3 days, 1 mg/kg/day of oral, which was tapered gradually and 1 g pulse of cycslophosphamide monthly associated with colchicine 1 mg/day. Consequently, the thrombus in the right atrium has substantially decreased in size. At five months follow-up, a complete resolution of the thrombi in the right atrium, vena cava and pulmonary artery tree was observed."
79,418439,942204,260268,"K.J., a 26-year-old male, first presented at the Drug Prevention and Treatment Centre with his wife in November 1997. They both asked to be treated for heroin addiction. Before admission they had been treated once as out-patients without success. He first used heroin a year later, in 1995, intravenously from the start, beginning with half a gram once a week; six months later his dose had increased to a gram a day. By then he was shooting up daily. He had never had any physical illness. Once he was hospitalized because of overdose, although opiate antagonist medication was not necessary. The concentration in the blood of morphine, the catabolite of heroin, was 0.05 mg/l. At the time of admission no internal medicine or neurological disorder could be found, while dysthymia and emotional lability were observed in the psychiatric state without psychotic symptoms or disorientation. Laboratory tests showed no abnormality. Detoxification with clonidine was followed by rapid relapse. He was never abstinent for longer than a week.
His wife recounted that on January 8, 1999, the day before his death, they had decided to begin withdrawal the following day. Next day, January 9, the wife remained at home and K.J. set out for work. What happened after that can be reconstructed from the forensic medical report and from information given by drug-using friends. On the way to work K.J. changed his mind and, breaking his promise to his wife, went to the dealer and bought a dose of heroin. He met other drug-using friends there who had bought heroin from the same dealer that day and later told the author that the heroin purchased then did not differ in quality from the usual. K.J. did not return home with the heroin purchased as he did on other occasions but went to the public toilet in the pedestrian underpass at the Népliget Metro station where he injected the same quantity (0.5 gram) that he had taken the previous day in the accustomed place, at home with his wife. The authorities called out were unable to help and pronounced him dead. A syringe half filled with a yellowish-brown fluid and a sooty spoon were found beside the body. The fluid in the syringe was heroin, while the metabolite of heroin, 6-0-acetylmorphine, and morphine-3-0-glucuronid were found in the blood and urine.
The autopsy found numerous traces of punctures by injection needles of various age on both upper limbs, the left side of the neck and the lower limbs. Traces of an infected but healing needle puncture were found inside the right elbow. Examination of the internal organs showed signs of general, very acute circulatory failure: acute congestive plethora of the organs, cerebral oedema, heightened brain pressure, cerebellar inclusion, acutely inflated lungs. The concentration in the blood of morphine, the catabolite of heroin, was 0.05 mg/l. The dose did not differ from the accustomed, daily dose. Other substances (alcohol, benzodiazepines, barbiturates) were not found. Heroin 'overdose' was given as the cause of death."
80,418439,394486,152134,"A 33-year-old white man with a 5-day history of fever, was hospitalized on May 2004. He also reported epigastralgia and pain in the right leg. He had an history of femoral deep venous thrombosis ten years before. His mother and his brother had an history of deep venous thrombosis and his father died because of pulmonary embolism. Physical examination revealed fever (temperature range 38°C–38°5C), asthenia, headache, anorexia and epigastralgia. His right leg was enlarged and painful. Tibiopopliteal deep venous thrombosis was confirmed by Doppler ultrasonography. At the time of hospital admission, his WBC was 6,000 cells/mm3, with 2,100 neutrophils/mm3 and 2,820 lymphocytes/mm3, with 9% of hyperbasophilic lymphocytes. His platelet count was 120,000/mm3 and his hemoglobin level was 141 g/l. The C-reactive protein level was 52 mg/l. Liver function tests revealed an ALT level of 65 UI/l, an AST level of 64 UI/l, an LDH level of 891 UI/l, a PAL level of 61 UI/l and a γ-GT level of 41 UI/l. Blood cultures were sterile. The results of serological tests for HIV ELISA, hepatitis A IgM, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C virus, Q fever, and toxoplasma were negative. VCA and EBNA IgG antibodies were positive suggesting past immunization. Serological test for CMV ELISA was strongly positive for IgM antibodies. The result of a CMV pp65 antigenemia assay, based on the direct detection of the CMV pp65 phosphoprotein was positive. A second serological test for CMV taken two weeks after the first one showed seroconversion with appearance of IgG. No pathological values for prothrombin time ratio, activated partial thromboplastin time, plasma antithrombin III, protein C and S activity were found. Results of tests for anticardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant and prothrombin 20210 were negative. Antinuclear antibodies were negative and complement was normal. Factor V Leiden heterozygous mutation was found. Anticoagulant treatment was introduced. Tthe patient became asymptomatic and was discharged from the hospital."
81,427495,334502,643976,"A 30-year old primigravida presented to our center on 17 October 2003 with a one year history of abdominal swelling and amenorrhea of 19 weeks duration. The abdominal swelling started as a small lump but markedly increased in size in the preceding 3 months. It was associated with pain, severe epigastric discomfort, constipation, weakness and swelling of the legs.
The patient was ill-looking, clinically pale and had bilateral pitting pedal edema. The pulse rate was 80 beats per minute and the blood pressure was 120/80 mmHg. The respiratory rate was 24 cycles per minute. The abdomen was grossly distended and tense. There was a massive central abdomino-pelvic mass which was firm and irregular, measuring 40 cm from the symphysis pubis.
Abdominal sonography showed an intra-uterine viable singleton fetus of 20 weeks gestation. It also showed a 30 cm multi-loculated cystic tumor with a thick capsule located at the right posterior-superior aspect of the uterus and free fluid in the peritoneal cavity. A sonographic diagnosis of ovarian tumor in pregnancy was made.
Blood tests showed a hematocrit of 22%, and normal electrolytes, urea and creatinin levels. The woman's blood group was 0 Rhesus positive and the hemoglobin genotype was AA. Malaria treatment was started following a positive smear test and two units of sedimented cells were administered to correct the anaemia. Because of the severity of the symptoms and the sonographic findings being suspicious of malignancy, surgery was proposed and discussed with the patient. Laparotomy was performed under general anaesthesia with endotracheal intubation. Operative findings included ascites, normal liver, spleen, kidneys, diaphragm, ovaries and fallopian tubes. The uterus was soft and the size was adequate for 20 weeks of gestation. Fetal movements were visible. A cystic subserosal fibroid measuring 32 cm in diameter was situated at the right posterior superior aspect of the uterus. [Fig ]
The subserosal fibroid was adherent to the omentum and the anterior abdominal wall. It was removed and the myoma bed was quickly closed with 2-0 polyglactin suture and hemostasis was easily achieved. The estimated blood loss was 600 mls and 2 units of whole blood were transfused intra-operatively. The tumor weighing 7.7 kg was sent for histology.
Intravenous magnesium sulphate was administered to prevent uterine contractions and the woman had an uneventful post-operative follow up. The post-operative hematocrit was 30% and the woman was discharged from the hospital 10 days after the operation. The histology report showed sections of interlacing bundles of smooth muscles with areas of hyaline degeneration with no evidence of malignancy. Repeat sonography during antenatal care visits showed a normally growing fetus and the remainder of the antenatal period was uneventful. The woman went into spontaneous labor at 38 weeks gestation and delivered vaginally a female baby weighing 3.5 kg with Apgar scores of 8 and 10 at one and five minutes, respectively. Two days post partum the maternal hematocrit was 30% and mother and baby were discharged from the hospital. The 6 weeks post-natal visit was unremarkable."
82,427495,885538,274875,"A 72-year-old woman was referred to our Catheterization Laboratory for an invasive re-evaluation of her NYHA class III heart failure symptoms. Three months before she had received, at a different Institution, the echocardiographic diagnosis of moderate aortic and apparently trivial mitral stenosis, despite severe valve calcification, with mild LV hypertrophy (wall thickness was 13 mm) and good systolic function. A pharmacological regimen, consisting in enalapril and furosemide, both 20 mg a day, had been established; despite medical therapy she kept complaining of effort dyspnea. ECG (figure ) had revealed a first degree AV block, PR interval measuring 290 milliseconds, with normal QRS duration.
She underwent left and right cardiac catheterization with trans-septal access to the left atrium. Coronary arteries and regional LV systolic function were angiographically normal. LV ejection fraction was 0.65, cardiac index was 2.6 L/min/m2 and aortic and pulmonary systolic pressure were 130 and 38 mmHg, respectively. Aortic stenosis was confirmed to be moderate (the ventricle-to-aorta gradient was 50 mmHg at catheter pullback and aortic valve area was calculated to be 1.0 cm2). At fluoroscopy the mitral annulus was heavily calcified, but there was no hemodynamic evidence of mitral stenosis. With the trans-septal technique, moreover, we demonstrated (figure ) that atrial contraction prematurely occurred soon after mitral valve opening, as shown on the left atrial tracing by the (corresponding to atrial systole) falling very close to the preceding (corresponding to early-diastolic unloading of the atrium into the ventricle). The high and prominent consequently represented marked pressure elevation and reduced compliance of both left atrium and ventricle. Furthermore, LV filling pressure was as increased by the preceding atrial contraction as to cause a 6-mmHg end-diastolic ventriculo-atrial gradient that was evident, at the time of the R wave on the ECG, between the (corresponding to the atrial relaxation not followed by a properly timed ventricular contraction) and the LV pressure tracing.
We discussed with the patient the therapeutic options []: she preferred to defer aortic valve replacement, whereas accepted to undergo permanent pacing. We performed an echocardiographic evaluation of systolic and diastolic function before pacemaker implantation (Table ). Of note, the functional deterioration could be explained by the evidence of a grade II diastolic dysfunction[]: transmitral flow was showing a high-velocity (150 cm/s) single filling wave with a deceleration time of 155 ms. Dual-chamber pacemaker implantation with optimal restoration of AV synchrony (programmed AV delay 150 ms) resulted in clinical improvement up to NYHA class II on the same medications. Since both sinus node function and atrial sensing were satisfying, ventricular pacing was triggered by P wave with a QRS duration of 120 ms [-]. The echocardiographic evaluation 2 days after pacemaker implantation showed a reduction of both diastolic dysfunction[] to grade I (pattern of abnormal relaxation with an E/A ratio of 0.6) and pulmonary artery systolic pressure to 28 mmHg, whereas cardiac output appeared to be slightly improved (Table ) despite the depletive effect of furosemide could have kept the systolic performance lower than expected in such a hypertrophied, non-enlarged left ventricle with aortic stenosis. The patient is now under close echocardiographic monitoring for the optimal timing of aortic valve replacement."
83,435048,604112,319306,"A well built 76-year-old otherwise healthy male who was a known case of node negative squamous cell carcinoma of the left buccal mucosa, involving left retro molar trigone region, anterior tonsillar pillar and soft palate, and was treated with 60 Gy of external beam radiation using photons over 30 fractions delivered using cobalt 60 source in 1998, presented six years later in 2004 with the gradually progressive swelling and pain in left malar region for last 3 months. He developed numbness of left cheek and blurring of vision in left eye along with epiphora of left eye and nasal obstruction of left nare. There were episodes of epistaxis. He was a chronic chewer and smoker for more than 30 years but quit the habit after diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma in 1998. Examination showed a bony swelling in left malar region measuring 2 × 3 cm, with diffused margins and blunting of infra orbital rim. Parasthesia of cheek left side, epiphora, blurring of vision in left eye, and obstruction of left nare were also present. Overlying skin appeared normal. Intra orally a total edentulous mouth and tender bony swelling in left maxillary alveolar region involving both buccal and palatal aspect was noted. Swelling was more pronounced over the buccal aspect and extended along whole of the anterior wall of maxilla. Computed tomographic scan demonstrated radiodense mass in left maxillary sinus with expansion of the anterolateral and posterolateral wall (figure ). Tumor was seen to be infiltrating the orbital fat. At surgery the tumor was seen infiltrating ethmoid sinus, pterygoid muscles, lateral wall of nose and superomedial part of orbit. A local wide excision with left radical maxillectomy and orbital exenteration was carried out. The defect was grafted.
Microscopic examination of the resected specimen demonstrated, a neoplasm composed of sheets of spindle cells having eosinophilic cytoplasm and hyper chromatic nuclei (figure ). Laying of osteoid by the tumor cells was seen. Scattered mitotic figures were noted. The picture was consistent with osteogenic sarcoma of maxilla T3N0M0G1 AJCC stage III. The patient is disease free and on regular follow-up 6 months after the surgery."
84,442472,43930,445911,"A 40-year-old lady presented to our institute with recurrent pain, redness, watering and blurred vision of seven months duration. During this time she had received topical steroids, antiviral and antifungal medications. However, there was no resolution in the signs or symptoms. The treating surgeon felt she was worsening and referred her as a case of crystalline keratopathy due to the nature of the stromal infiltrate. At presentation, she had a BCVA of perception of light and accurate projection of rays. There was 1+ lid edema and conjunctival congestion. There was a central mid to deep stromal infiltrate measuring 1.5 × 1.5 mm with surrounding stromal edema (figure ). The overlying epithelium was intact with epithelial edema. Endothelium showed exudates arranged as a sheet over an area of 5.0 × 5.0 mm. There was 360° of superficial vascularisation. Since the infiltrate had not shown any signs of resolution and there was no definitive diagnosis in hand, all the medications were discontinued and she underwent a penetrating keratoplasty for that eye on 25/03/02. The post-operative period was uneventful and at last follow up she was doing well with a BCVA of 6/18. She was treated with topical Chloramphenicol, Prednisolone acetate1%, and Lacrigel. She was later prescribed Tablet Itraconazole 100 mg BD for one month. Her immune status was found to be normal."
85,442472,887584,660102,Parents of a 2-year-old male child brought him with complaints of white spot on the black of the left eye and swelling of the lids since one and half months. The child had red eye three months back which subsided with eyedrops (Ofloxacin and Tobramycin) but the opacity persisted. Vision could not be assessed as he was photophobic. Examination under anaesthesia revealed flat lids and a quiet conjunctiva. The cornea showed the presence of a mid to deep stromal infiltrate 1.0 × 1.0 mm with surrounding cellular reaction. There was surrounding stromal edema extending about 2 mm from the infiltrate edges. AC was deep and quiet. The IOP was within normal limits. A diagnosis of resolving infectious keratitis or a HSV stromal immune keratitis was kept in mind and he was started on Cefazolin eye drops 2 hourly with close follow up. He showed improvement and 15 days later four hourly Betamet e/d was added. The child was comfortable. He returned two months later with a recurrence of the stromal infiltration in the same location. Deep corneal scrapings were done under anaesthesia which revealed spores suggestive of Microsporidium. He was started on oral Itraconazole 50 mg BD. After 15 days of therapy there was no response and considering the risk of amblyopia a penetrating keratoplasty was done on 8/04/02. The post operative period was uneventful and the child is doing well and is relieved of his symptoms as noticed by his parents.
86,455040,808133,102874,"A 70-year old female presented with complaints of pain, redness, watering and diminution of vision in the left eye of one month duration. She gave history of injury with grass six months ago. Visual acuity in right eye was 6/12 and hand movements with counting finger in the left eye. Right eye on examination was within normal limits. Left eye lids were edematous, conjunctiva was congested, cornea showed the presence of an anterior mid stromal infiltrate in nasal paracentral area with overlying epithelial defect of 1.5 × 1.5 mm (figure ). In the temporal paracentral area, there was an area of deep stromal infiltrate with underlying endothelial exudate. Smears revealed gram-negative oval bodies. Cultures were positive for gram-positive cocci and gram-positive bacilli. Patient was started on Cefazolin eye drops half hourly. The clinical picture was the same at one and half months, therefore a decision was taken to penetrating keratoplasty in the left eye. Post-operative period was uneventful."
87,455040,380360,500351,"A 37-year-old male presented with history of injury in left eye during a fight years ago. His vision decreased but he did not use any medications. On examination, vision in right eye was 6/6 and in the left eye it was PL positive, PR accurate. Right eye examination was within normal limits. Left eye showed trace conjunctival congestion, there was diffuse corneal scarring with central descemetocoele. Anterior chamber view was hazy and there was total cataract. He underwent optical penetrating keratoplasty with extracapsular cataract extraction with intraocular lens implantation under local anesthesia in left eye. The post-operative period was uneventful and at last follow-up his vision in the left eye was 20/400.
Four patients in this series had presented as ulcerative keratitis and one as post-traumatic corneal ectasia. Two of the four patients, diagnosed as stromal keratitis, underwent deep stromal scrapings, which demonstrated microsporidial spores. The diagnosis was made on observing oval refractile bodies in the corneal scrapings, both within cells as well as in extracellular location. The Gram (figure ) and Giemsa stained smears revealed variable staining of the parasites. The oval body had a dark polar nucleus. The parasite was acid fast and appeared as red oval structure on smears stained with 1% acid fast stain (figure ). Corneal scrapings stained with calcofluor white showed oval fluorescent bodies in clumps. Bacterial and fungal cultures from these cases did not reveal any organisms except in one case (case 4) that showed a significant growth of Staphylococcus epidermidis.
Three cases were initially treated medically based on the findings of smear examination. In case 1 the treatment was started with fortified cefazolin and fortified gentamicin even though oval bodies were seen in the smear examination. In other two cases where scraping was performed the treatment was started with oral itraconazole 100 mg twice daily and topical ciprofloxacin 0.3%. The infiltrate resolved with medical therapy in one case. Even this case developed progressive thinning for which tissue adhesive and bandage contact lens was applied. Penetrating keratoplasty was performed in four cases. The indications were non-responding keratitis in three cases and thinning with ectasia in one case. Postoperatively all cases were managed with corticosteroids (Prednisolone acetate 1%). The graft was clear in all cases with no evidence of recurrence of infection."
88,465541,484587,358959,"An 84-year old white male, presented at the Department of Dermatology (6th IKA Oncological Hospital of Athens) with a pale, ulcerated lesion (1.3 cm in diameter), on the middle of his lower lip. There was no associated lymphadenopathy and an excisional biopsy was performed. Histopathological and immunoistochemical features revealed a Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) but as the excision was incomplete the patient was sheduled for a wider excision in the following 2 months. In the meantime, the lesion recurred and the patient returned with a protruding white lesion of 1.1 cm in diameter. There was no associated lynphadenopathy and a wider excision, with an 8 mm margin, was performed. Histopathology confirmed the nature of MCC and the second excision was within healthy margins.
Two months later, the patient was referred to the Depatment of Plastic Surgery, for another protruding ulcerated lesion, 3 cm in diameter, on his lower lip (Fig ). On examination, multiple palpable lymph nodes in the submandibular and cervical area (superficial and deep cervical lymphadenopathy) were present.
Past medical history revealed that 8 years earlier, the patient had been diagnosed as having chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), (nodular and intermediate type), but he didn't receive any treatment. CT scan of the head and neck area, showed a soft tissue lobular mass, 3 cm in diameter, on the lower lip, with a possible extension to the mandible. The past medical history of CLL with the recent occurence of MCC posed a problem in the differential diagnosis of the patient's lymphadenopathy. A W-excision (4 × 3.5 × 1 cm) of the lip lesion was performed, with an open biopsy of one submandibular lymph node.
Histopathology, confirmed recurrence of MCC. An undifferentiated small cell carcinoma with hyaluronated stroma was identified. The cells arranged in nodules or rosettes, had dense nuclear chromatin, with mitoses and nuclear debris which are regular features of MCC (Fig. , ).
Immunoistochemical procedures showed Neuron Specific Enolase (NSE) positivity, while antibodies for Epithelial Membrane Antigen (EMA) and Chromogranin were negative. The excision was described as complete. The submandibular lymph node was positive for malignacy but was associated with the CLL (non Hodgkin's, B cell small lymhocytic lymphoma). There was no evidence of metastatic infiltration by MCC and this was confirmed immunoistochemically with the positive expression of CD5 and CD20 antibody and negative expression of CD10 antibody and NSE. Due to the age of the patient, chemotherapy was not considered.
A month later, a new CT scan of the head and neck, depicted a soft tissue mass, consistent with recurrence of MCC, between the left angle of the mandible and the hyoid bone. Multiple enlarged superficial and deep cervical lymph nodes were present. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the submandibular swelling was performed and confirmed MCC (small atypical cells were found, isolated or forming rosettes and exhibited dense core granules of chromatin and scanty cytoplasm). The patient underwent one month of neck radiotherapy with Cobalt 60, a total dose of 4600cGy in 23 days. A further boost of 600cGy in 2 days, on the left submandibular area was administered.
The treatment was successfully completed with full remission of the cervical lymphadenopathy. Two months following the radiotherapy, a new CT scan of the head and neck showed reduction and obscurrence of the pre-existing mass on the left mandibular area, while the lymph nodes were smaller too. The patient is on regular follow up and CLL status is stable with no evidence of progression or further recurrence of MCC 9 months post- radiotherapy."
89,465541,557964,470641,"A 60-year-old male was diagnosed with anaplastic astrocytoma involving the left parietal and temporal lobes. The patient underwent surgical resection with subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-proven complete excision.
In the context of a clinical trial, exploring the role of high-dose chemo-radiotherapy in malignant glioma, the patient underwent high dose sequential chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide 7 g/m2 plus rhG-CSF (5 μg/kbw) and hematopoietic cells harvest, followed by methotrexate 8 g/m2 and thiotepa 900 mg/m2. Autologous unfractionated hematopoietic stem cells were administered at doses of 7.5 × 106/kg CD34+ cells and the patient experienced an uncomplicated hematological recovery within 10 days.
One month later, the patient received 70-Gy of fractioned whole-brain irradiation, and steroids (dexamethasone 8 mg i.v. bid) were administered for 2 months and than tapered at the end of radiotherapy.
On day +105 he was hospitalized because of the occurrence of right hilum lymphoadenopathy associated with cutaneous lesions, as limited erythematous plaques, with well-demarcated margins and scalings.
Surgical nodes and skin excision showed the presence of HD, nodular sclerosis type, with atypical HD-like elements, infiltrating the skin. The staging evaluation, performed by CT scan of abdomen and thorax and bone marrow biopsy, was negative for distant involvement (stage IA) and no treatment was administered after radical surgery.
Eight months after HSCT, the malignant glioma relapsed and the patient received 2 cycles of carmustine (240 mg/m2 i.v. q.6 weeks) without clinical benefit, followed by palliative neurosurgical subtotal excision. The steroids treatment was resumed (dexamethasone 4 mg, daily) and chronically administered as supportive care.
Six months later, histological-confirmed HD relapse occurred as bilateral hilum lymphoadenopaty. Because of deteriorated neurological clinical conditions, the patient declined any further treatment and died 2 months later for progressive glioma.
Lymph node and skin biopsies were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and paraffin embedded. Micron sections were then prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Paraffin section immunohistochemical stains were performed using a biotin-streptavidin technique. The lymph node structure and the skin biopsy were diffusely effaced by a growth consisting of polymorphic features of small T-cell-rich B cell lymphoma/HD-like, and typical Hodgkin's and Reed-Sternberg cells (HRSCs), nodular sclerosis type with limited areas of lymphocyte depletion (REAL) (Fig. and ). At immunohistochemistry, HRSCs expressed the following molecules: CD30+, CD43+, CD15+/-, CD3+/-; and were negative for EMA, ALK and CD20.
EBV latent membrane protein (LMP-1) was weakly positive at HRSCs immunohistochemistry, but EBV-DNA determination by PCR [] performed in multiple node biopsy fragments and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) yielded negative results.
According to the clinical, histological and immunohistochemical findings, HD consistent with non EBV-associated PTLD was diagnosed."
90,465712,644114,556122,"Patient 1 is a 51 year old man from Ecuador, with severe large plaque psoriasis for 15 years, and a strong family history of psoriasis. His medical background included recent-onset hypertension and diabetes, and renal calculi. He takes lisinopril and glyburide, as well as doxepin and atarax when required. His past psoriasis treatments include topical steroids, methotrexate (not tolerated due to nausea), and UVB with minimal effect.
He was first seen at The Rockefeller University, NY, USA, in December 2000 and received numerous courses of biological therapies in the context of our clinical trials program. He initially received efalizumab (100 mg [1 mg/kg] sc weekly for 12 weeks) with good effect. His re-treatment with efalizumab was required in May 2001 because of a sunburn-induced flare, and was permitted under our clinical trial protocol. Another psoaisis flare in Sept 2001 was treated with alefacept (7.5 mg IV for 12 weekly doses) with good effect. Subsequent disease exacerbations were managed well with a course of daclizumab (anti-CD25) therapy, NB-UVB, and cyclosporine.
Due to previous success with efalizumab and recent USA FDA approval, a disease flare in March 2004 was managed with efalizumab at the standard dose (1 mg/kg/wk sc) at a private clinic. However, he missed a dose in June 2004 and his skin flared again, so he re-attended our clinic (Fig ). Despite missing a dose, there was still leukocyte CD11a saturation by efalizumab (Fig. , solid line identical to isotype, shaded). At this time, his psoriasis was complicated by Staphlococcal skin infection. To gain control of his skin disease and while waiting for his skin infection to respond to antibiotic treatment (dicloxicillin), he was given low-dose NB-UVB. Efalizumab was re-commenced in September 2004 with good result (110 mg/wk, 1 mg/kg). This has been continued and the patient is currently in remission.
Immunohistochemistry during the flare reaction (Fig. ), shows there are relatively less lesional CD3+ cells compared to untreated psoriasis, and they are predominantly all CD8+. CD103 is also expressed on epidermal T cells. In addition, there are abundant CD11c+ and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)+ inflammatory cells infiltrating the dermis and epidermis. CD14+ cells are relatively rare (not shown)."
91,465712,525593,448135,"Patient 2 is a 33 year-old Australian-born Caucasian female with a 14 year history of severe plaque psoriasis, and psoriatic arthritis for 12 years. Her first presentation of psoriasis was with erythroderma at 19 years old. Her past medical history included appendicectomy, infectious mononucleosis, and Chloroquine-resistant P. falciparum malaria at age 15 years following travel to Papua New Guinea. She was not taking any medications at the time of initial referral to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital Department of Dermatology, New South Wales, Australia, in 1994.
Past rotational treatments for her psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis included cyclosporine (1990 and 1995), methotrexate (1993 and 1996), acitretin (1994 and 1997), as well as periodic courses of NB-UVB. She was hospitalized in 1999 for erythrodermic psoriasis. In 2001 her psoriasis flared and other therapies tried without success were mycophenolate mofetil, hydroxyurea, tacrolimus, and thioguanine. From July 2001 to November 2002 she received periodic treatment with cyclosporine and acitretin therapy, with poor disease control.
Over the next 2.5 years, this patient was treated with a number of newer biological therapies with standard dosing, sometimes requiring cyclosporine cover and subsequent withdrawal as the patient responded. Etanercept (anti-TNF receptor) (Dec 2002–Feb 2003, 25 mg sc twice week) was initially successful, but was ceased on relapse to erythroderma. Alefacept (anti-CD2) (15 mg IM weekly for 3 months) had no beneficial effect.
Efalizumab (anti-CD11a) (80 mg [1 mg/kg] sc weekly, Dec 2003) induced a dramatic clinical response, and after 6 weeks, cyclosporine was ceased. The patient missed the 18th dose of efalizumab, but the regular dose was given at the subsequent visit. Two days after the ""catchup"" dose, the patient developed a psoriatic flare involving extensive plaques on all body surfaces. Immunohistochemistry at this time (Fig. ) shows similar results to patient 1: there are relatively reduced CD3+ and CD8+ cells, epidermal T cells are CD103+, and there are abundant CD11c+ and iNOS+ inflammatory cells infiltrating the dermis and epidermis.
During this flare, NB-UVB was administered concomitantly with efalizumab, however a UVB-induced burn was associated with recurrence of her psoriasis. However, by June 2004 there was almost confluent severe plaque psoriasis again with features of erythroderma. The efalizumab dose was increased to 125 mg (1.5 mg/kg) sc weekly, but was ceased in Sept 2004 as there was no further improvement.
Infliximab (anti-TNF-α) (400 mg [5 mg/kg] at 0 and 2 weeks, followed by 400 mg every 6 weeks) was commenced with excellent effect for 4 months, when the patient then experienced another flare of her psoriasis. It was decided to carefully combine infliximab and efalizumab therapy. In February 2005, 62.5 mg (0.7 mg/kg) efalizumab was given sc, and a second dose of 125 mg (1.4 mg/kg) a week later, and she started to respond clinically. She is currently well controlled on this therapy."
92,473704,59381,485993,"A 56 year old male presented with complaint of acute onset painless diminution of vision in the right eye of 3 days duration followed by similar complaint in left eye after 1 day which deteriorated over the next 2 days. This was associated with headache and pain on ocular movements. There was a history of being bitten by a stray dog 8 days before the visual symptoms, and the patient had received three injections of chick embryo cell anti-rabies vaccine (Rabipur, Hoeshst Marion Roussel) on day 0, 3 and 7 after the dog bite. He developed these symptoms after the third injection. There was no history of any other ocular or systemic problems.
The general physical examination was within normal limits. The best-corrected visual acuity was 6/60 in the right and 6/24 in the left eye. IOP was 16 mm of Hg by applanation tonometry. Anterior segment examination using slitlamp was normal. Fundoscopy using + 90 D revealed hyperemic optic disc with blurred margins and disc edema. Vessels were tortuous and macular star was present in the nasal part of macula of both the eyes (Fig ). Pupils were sluggishly reacting in both the eyes. Goldmann perimetry revealed centrocaecal scotoma in both eyes which was more dense in the right eye as compared to the left.
The routine blood investigations were all within normal limits. The aerobic and aerobic cultures were sterile. The VDRL test and indirect haemagglutination test for syphillis and toxoplasmosis were normal. Serology for bartonella was negative. Mantoux test showed a reading of 8 mm. and the chest X-ray was normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain and optic nerves revealed slight signal enhancement of both the optic nerves with slight increase in optic nerve thickness on axial T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. No other significant abnormality was seen in MRI of brain.
A diagnosis of bilateral neuroretinitis was made. As the dog which had bitten the patient was kept under observation and was alive after one week, further injections of antirabies vaccine were stopped. The patient was given three doses of pulse dexamethasone 100 mg in 150 ml of 5% dextrose. The visual acuity improved to 6/6 in both the eyes over the next two weeks. The disc oedema start resolving within one week but macular exudates took 4 months to resolve."
93,473704,588554,387968,"A 36-year-old male, was admitted to our Heart department: He experienced progressive dyspnea on effort and at rest. During the physical examination, he was found to have low blood pressure (90/60 mmHg), sinusal tachycardia and gallop rhythm. An olosistolic murmur was heard in the mitral area. Rales were available on pulmonary auscultation. The electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed sinus rhythm and left ventricular hypertrophy (Fig. ).
Chest x-ray showed left atrial and ventricular enlargement; alveolar edema in the hilar regions of both lung fields.
The echocardiogram (TTE) showed left ventricular enlargment, atrial dilatation, moderate/severe mitral regurgitation and moderate aortic regurgitation; mitral valve masses were suspected.
Based on this diagnosis, the patient underwent a transesophageal-echo (TEE).
TEE showed, on apical 4-chamber section, an anulare structure attached from a membrane to the atrial wall anterior mitral valve leaflet and just proximal to the posterior mitral leaflet (Fig. , ).
This supravalvular ring was proximal to the left atrial appendage, in contradistinction to ""cor triatriatum""; it restricted the leaflets movement and impaired their opening. A severe mitral regurgitation (IV grade PISA) and mild diastolic gradient (6 mm/Hg DP mean) was detected by the Doppler-echocardiography (see ).
A moderate/severe aortic regurgitation was seen. Mitral vegetations were not identified. Coronary angiography was normal; left cineventriculography showed a severe aortic and mitral regurgitation, but a mitral supravalvular structure was not noticed.
Based on TEE diagnosis, the patient underwent surgery in November 2002.
A left atriotomy enabled the identification of a membrane right above the mitral valve with 2 small openings that allowed blood to flow from the atrium to the left ventricle. The membrane was excised and the mitral and aortic valves were replaced. Follow up: after 6 month, the patient was in I NYHA class. The transtoracic echo showed a normal function of prostesis."
94,474486,45765,256448,"A 40-year-old woman received excision of a superficial spreading melanoma from the rima ani with a safety margin of 3 cm (Clark-Level IV, tumor thickness 1,82 mm). Lymphatic drainage was detected to both inguinal basins and both excised sentinel lymph nodes were unaffected. None of the staging examinations including computer tomography (CT) of the brain, chest, abdomen and pelvis, as well as lymph node sonography revealed any signs of tumor manifestation. The medical history of the patient was otherwise unremarkable and she was not on any medication. There was no family history of hypertension, heart disease or pulmonary disease. Because of the high-risk nature of the melanoma, the patient started long-term adjuvant therapy with IFN α2b (5 × 10 million U. s.c. per week for 4 weeks followed by 3 × 10 million U. s.c. per week).
After 30 months of IFN α2b treatment the patient reported increasing dyspnea on exertion and afebrile non-productive coughing accompanied by sudden malaise and edema of the lower legs. Electrocardiography showed sinus tachycardia (120 /min) and right axis deviation. A chest x-ray showed signs of right ventricular dilatation and pleural effusion on the right side; no pneumonic infiltrates were seen. Abdominal sonography revealed a significant amount of ascites. The patient was diagnosed with decompensated right heart failure and was therefore hospitalized. Initial investigations with transthoracic echocardiography showed right ventricular hypertrophy and dilatation (Figure ), PAH with a calculated systolic pulmonary artery pressure (PAPsyst) of 80 mmHg and tricuspid insufficiency grade II-III with morphologically normal valves (Figure ), a reduced right ventricular ejection fraction of 40%, a hypokinetic right ventricle and pericardial effusion without signs of tamponade. Laboratory work-up showed slightly increased levels of d-dimers and liver enzymes, while inflammatory markers were within the normal range. There were no signs of vasculitis, hypercoagulability or rheumatologic disorders. A high-resolution CT of the chest revealed no signs of pulmonary embolism, alveolar or interstitial lung diseases, but signs of PAH with a widened central pulmonary artery (40 mm), right ventricular dilatation (> 80 mm), regurgitation of contrast medium into liver veins, a circular pericardial effusion and a 300–400 ml pleural effusion of the right side.
Diagnostic right heart catheter revealed a PAPmean of 56 mmHg (PAPsyst 87 mmHg), a pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) of 1.128 dyn × sec × cm-5, an impaired cardiac index and a 3 fold increased total peripheral resistance. Testing of pulmonary vasoreactivity showed a reduction of PAPmean from 56 mmHg to 26 mmHg with the PDE-5-inhibitor sildenafil (Table ).
Therefore, treatment with 3 × 25 mg sildenafil per day was initiated. No side effects occurred. After one month, tricuspid insufficiency improved to grade I-II. After six months right ventricular hypertrophy and dilatation were reduced. Because of the 2 documented cases of patients with PAH due to therapy with IFNα2 where PAH was reversible half a year after termination of IFNα2 [,] we attempted to terminate sildenafil under control of hemodynamic monitoring. PAPmean increased promptly to 57 mmHg. In this context we could verify the same effectiveness for therapy with vardenafil in comparison to sildenafil. Reduction of PVR was higher in vardenafil vs. sildenafil (Table ); therefore the therapy was switched from sildenafil to vardenafil 10 mg twice daily. 24 months after onset of PAH the patient felt fine and resumed working. Vardenafil is still necessary to lower her PAP as demonstrated with transthoracic echocardiography: after pausing vardenafil for two days the PAPsyst increased about 40 mmHg, but decreased again 120 minutes after administration of vardenafil. The heart diameter is steadily decreasing (right ventricular outflow tract from 39 to 27 mm and right atrium from 60–65 to 36–44 mm). Regarding the melanoma she remains relapse-free."
95,474486,767303,288846,"We present a case of a 51-year-old otherwise healthy man, who suffered from rapid visual loss in the left eye following contusion. Ocular trauma was caused during a football match by a ball, which hit an index finger located just in front of the bulbus. The patient attended our department on April 27, 2004, one week after the injury, when the vision in the left eye decreased to light perception with inaccurate light projection and hand movements in a lower part of visual field. The best-corrected visual acuity in the right eye was 1.0. Intraocular pressures were 18 mmHg in the right eye and 45 mmHg in the left eye. Examination of the anterior segment and fundus of the right eye revealed no pathology. The left eye showed discrete injection of the conjunctiva and keratic precipitates with mild anterior chamber flare and cells. There was iridodonesis, cleft syndrome and a relative afferent pupillary defect in the left eye. The fundus examination of the left eye revealed swelling of the optic disc, large ischemic macular edema, superficial retinal hemorrhages, narrowing of the arterioles and dilatation of the venules (Figure ). Fluorescein angiography of the left eye showed macular edema and vascular leakage in the venous phase (Figure ). Duplex Doppler ultrasonography and computed tomography scans of the brain and orbits were normal.
Based on the clinical findings, the presumed diagnosis of ocular ischemic syndrome was made. The patient was initially treated with vaso-active drugs in addition to corticosteroids. Intravenous methylprednisolone (500 mg daily for 5 days) followed by 60 mg of oral prednisone daily was indicated due to swelling of the optic disc and macular edema. Despite intensive therapy, the fundus examination showed progression of ischemic lesions. Visual acuity in the left eye was light perception with inaccurate light projection. The finding on the right eye was without changes. The patient was discharged on oral prednisone 50 mg daily.
On May 24, 2004, four weeks after pulse intravenous corticosteroid treatment, vision in the initially uninvolved right eye decreased to 0.25. Fundus examination of the right eye disclosed swelling of the optic disc with hemorrhages, blurring of the optic disk margins and ischemic macular edema (Figure ). In the left eye, massive vitreous opacities made evaluation of the fundus impossible.
A differential diagnosis of antiphospholipide syndrome, masquerading syndrome, viral retinitis or specific inflammation was considered.
No neurological or other abnormalities were found on systemic examination. The findings from magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography of brain and orbits were within normal limits. The cerebrospinal fluid was negative for VZV DNA and enteroviruses RNA. Chest X ray and abdominal ultrasonography were normal. Leukocyte count, hematocrit and activated partial tromboplastin time (APTT) were normal, liver tests showed elevated levels of alaninaminotranspherase (ALT; 2.63 ukat/l). Anti-cardiolipin antibodies were negative. Serologic tests for syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1/-2) were negative. Serum was evaluated regarding evidence for herpesviruses by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Low levels of VZV and EBV EBNA-1 IgG antibodies were detected in serum, whereas IgM antibodies were absent; as well antibodies of respiratory infections or neuroinfections were negative. Blood cultures were also negative. Immunofenotypization showed lower count of lymphocytes in peripheral blood, without plasma cell neoplasia.
On May 27, 2004, an aqueous tap of the left eye was performed and samples were submitted for cytological and virological analysis. PCR of aqueous humour was negative for herpesviruses family and cytology confirmed non-purulent intraocular inflammation. The patient was treated with corticosteroids. The best-corrected visual acuity in the right eye decreased to 0.02. Due to progressive impairment of the clinical status, the corticosteroid therapy was stopped. Fundus examination demonstrated several enlarging foci of necrotizing retinitis with extensive posterior pole involvement (Figure ). Based on the clinical appearance, a diagnosis of presumed necrotizing herpetic retinopathy was made. The patient was commenced on high-dose intravenous acyclovir (4 × 500 mg per day for 2 weeks). Two days later, visual loss with acuity reduced to light perception with inaccurate light projection occurred in the right eye. In the left eye, there was progression of vitreous opacities and the vision was light perception with inaccurate light projection.
On June 4, 2004, a diagnostic pars plana vitrectomy and retinal biopsy were carried out in the left eye. The vitreous cavity was filled with 16% perfluoropropane (C3F8) gas. A part of retina and samples of diluted and undiluted vitreous were obtained. Due to failure of the antiviral treatment and ocular disease progression, the patient underwent a pars plana vitrectomy in the right eye on June 9, 2004.
PCR of retina of the left eye and undiluted vitreous of both eyes were positive for VZV. Undiluted vitreous was negative for HSV-1 and -2, CMV, EBV. PCR of diluted vitreous was negative for herpesviruses family. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was not detected using PCR in vitreous of both eyes. Cultivation of vitreous for bacteria and fungi was negative; Toxoplasma gondii antibodies were also negative. Histopathological examination confirmed non-purulent intraocular inflammation. Immunofenotypization of vitreous of both eyes showed no plasma cell neoplasia.
In two weeks, intravenous acyclovir was followed by oral acyclovir (5 × 400 mg daily). In the right eye, large foci of retinal atrophy with reduced inflammatory reaction were present. Owing the cataract induced by gas, fundus of the left eye was not visible.
The patient was discharged on acyclovir 4 × 400 mg daily. However, an exudative retinal detachment was seen in the right eye and vision decreased to 0. Vision in the left eye was light perception with inaccurate light projection. On examination 4 weeks later, B-scan ultrasonography of the left eye confirmed the exudative retinal detachment. Nevertheless, despite intensive treatment with intravenous antiviral medication, the patient became completely blind in both eyes."
96,488070,540784,860462,"A-90-year-old female presented in November 2003 with a history of nausea, vomiting and dysphagia, with hematuria. On admission her abdomen was slightly distended, tympanic, and slightly tender in the upper abdominal regions, with normal bowel sounds and no palpable mass. Blood tests revealed a white blood cell count of 6,100/mm3, c reactive protein (CRP) 6.01 mg/dl, carcinoma antigen (CA) 19-9 50.6 mg/dl and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) of 2.9 mg/dl. Pelvic computed tomography (CT) identified an abnormal thickness of the bladder wall with enhance effect in a diverticulum and it's origin from bladder (Figure. ). Another mass was seen in the antral portion of the stomach; however, pancreas and biliary tract were normal on computed tomography. There was not other lesion detected in other abdominal and pelvic organs.
A gastroscopy was carried out which revealed type 3 pyloric stenosis. A biopsy of the stomach was taken which revealed well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma. Cystoscopy was performed which showed a lesion in the bladder diverticulum, a biopsy of the bladder wall revealed well-differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma metastasis from gastric carcinoma. At laparotomy, the pylorus segment of the stomach was viable with signs of edema, but no serosal invasion was identified. There were no sign of peritoneal dissemination in the intra-abdominal cavity. Peritoneal washings were negative for malignant cells. A palliative distal gastrectomy with gastrojejunostomy was performed to relieve pyloric obstruction.
However, cystectomy or diverticulectomy was not performed due to age of the patient and technical difficulties due to previous two surgeries performed for abnormal position of uterus and volvulus of intestine. The size of the macroscopic specimen was 3.0 × 2.5 cm (Figure. ). Histology revealed well differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma invading to the muscularis propria (MP), 3type, Infiltrative growth pattern (inf) β, int, ly3, v0 (Figure. , ), Similar to that of bladder tumor (Figure ). The patient recovered with no further symptoms, and was discharged on the 19th postoperative day. However, patient later developed pyelonephritis, bilateral hydronephrosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and died three months after the surgery."
97,488070,962126,700665,"A 82-year old lady presented to the Department of General Surgery at the University of Heidelberg, Germany with recurrent attacks of hypoglycemia and a large abdominal mass. While diagnostic tests repeatedly documented glucose levels below 40 mg/dl (normal levels 80 – 120 mg/dl), a computed tomography (CT) (Figure ) scan of the abdomen revealed a large lesion of around 5 to 6 cm in relation to the pancreatic body and tail. There were also large masses of about 3–5 cm in the retroperitoneum and in the area of the celiac trunk and around the mesenteric artery. Furthermore, in the pancreatic body there was a hypervascularized area (Figure ), that was suspicious for an insulinoma. Clinically this lady, who was not thriving, reported a weight loss of 12 kilograms over the previous 4 months. A somatostatin receptor scintigraphy showed an enhanced uptake in the region of the pancreatic body/tail as well as in the right axilla (a palpable mass was also noted there) and excluded the possibility of other involved areas.
She gave a past history of an operation done on the right eyebrow 2 years prior for a 0.8 × 0.8 cm lesion (Figure ) that was reported as a Merkel cell carcinoma. Histopathology showed rather uniform tumor cells in a trabecular growth pattern (Figure ) with monomorphous pale-stained nuclei and many mitoses (Figure ). There was invasion of dermal lymphatics and blood vessels (Figure , insert). Immunohistochemistry revealed strong positivity for cytokeratin 20 (Figure ) and neurofilament (not shown) in the characteristic dot-like pattern and a weak expression of chromogranin A (Figure ). After excision, radiation therapy was also administered only at the site of the primary lesion, the draining lymphatic vessels and the first lymph node station. A year later, a large abdominal mass was noted of uncertain origin and an ultrasound guided biopsy showed an unspecified small cell cancer. In view of the large mass with additional suspicious areas being noted in the spleen, left adrenal gland and axilla, she had been subjected to palliative radiotherapy of 30 Gray over 2 months. However no definitive diagnosis of metastasis in these areas was established. With a working clinical diagnosis of symptomatic insulinoma not responding to medical measures, a decision for surgical resection of this large lesion was inevitable, the age of the patient and the previous history of palliative radiation just 6 months prior notwithstanding.
Surgical exploration revealed a large mass of about 5 cm in the tail of the pancreas, in close proximity to the spleen and the splenic flexure of the transverse colon. However there was no evidence of any metastatic disease to the liver, peritoneum and the adnexae. After a careful and meticulous mobilization, a distal pancreatectomy, splenectomy, and adrenalectomy along with resection of the splenic flexure of the colon were performed.
Pathological examination revealed a tumor with manifestations in the pancreatic tail, the adrenal gland, the peripancreatic tissue, and the surrounding soft tissue. Grossly, the mass displayed a whitish and glassy cut surface, containing extended areas of haemorrhage and necrosis. Histologically, the tumor displayed endocrine architecture with mostly solid formations of rather monomorphic cells. The tumor was mitotically highly active (mitotic count >10 per high power field) and contained abundant areas of necrosis. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were strongly positive for the endocrine marker synaptophysin and for cytokeratin 20 while there was no expression of insulin. The proliferative activity (MIB-1) reached approximately 80% (Figure ).
Furthermore, gross examination of the resected specimen revealed a well demarcated, brownish tumor of the pancreatic body, measuring 1.2 cm in diameter. This tumor microscopically displayed endocrine architecture with trabecular arrangements of uniform tumor cells, showing no mitotic activity. Immunohistochemistry revealed strong positivity for synaptophysin as well as focal positivity for insulin. The proliferative activity (MIB-1) was approximately 1% (Figure ). The diagnosis of a poorly differentiated endocrine carcinoma (Merkel cell carcinoma) along with that of benign pancreatic insulinoma was thus made.
The patient had a smooth postoperative recovery, the bouts of hypoglycaemia completely disappeared, and she was discharged home within 3 weeks of surgery. She is presently asymptomatic and remains on regular follow up."
98,491988,14354,521908,"A 46-year-old lady was referred to the haematology clinic for evaluation of lymphocytosis in May 1993. She had severe lethargy and intermittent right upper abdominal discomfort without any significant loss in weight. Her past medical history included essential hypertension controlled on atenolol 100 mg once daily and was also on frusemide 40 mg once daily. She had no significant surgical history other than having undergone cholecystectomy in 1972. She had never smoked nor consumed alcohol. Physical examination showed no evidence of lymphadenopathy. Complete blood count showed normal haemoglobin concentration 14.8 g/dl, macrocytosis (MCV 100.1), raised white cell count at 13.4 × 109/L, lymphocytosis (absolute number 6.3 × 109/L), and normal neutrophil count (absolute number 5.6 × 109/L). Peripheral blood showed numerous Howell-Jolly bodies within erythrocytes. Thyroid function tests, protein electrophoresis, C-reactive protein, immunoglobulin levels and autoimmune screening were normal. Ultrasonography and computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis did not reveal retroperitoneal or mediastinal lymphadenopathy, but the spleen was noted to be very atrophic. Gastroscopy showed multiple gastric erosions and the initial impression was of celiac disease complicated by lymphoma and lymphocytosis.
Duodenal biopsy showed well-formed villi and no increase in intraepithelial lymphocytes thereby excluding celiac disease. Colonoscopy and barium studies were normal. She was clinically diagnosed to have functional hyposplenism, considering the presence of Howell-Jolly bodies, and was given hemophilus influenzae (HiB) vaccine, pneumovax vaccine and counselled for long term oral Penicillin V. In November 1994, another complete blood count showed a white cell count of 15.3 × 109/L with absolute number of lymphocytes of 6.6 × 109/L. Bone marrow biopsy showed 25% infiltration with large granular lymphocytes. Peripheral blood smear revealed that the majority of lymphocytes had atypical morphology with large atypical nuclei and abundant cytoplasm containing fine azurophilic granules. Immunophenotyping showed CD16+/CD3- cells which were mainly reactive and another clonal cells which were CD57+/CD8+ suggesting NK-LGL (Natural Killer-Large Granular Lymphocyte) activity. 80% CD3+ cells were α/β and 20% γ/δ and a clonal population of CD16+/CD56+ cells.
She presented in March 1995 with lethargy and diffuse enlargement of her thyroid gland. Lymphocytosis persisted (WBC 15.7 × 109/L, absolute lymphocyte count 8.2 × 109/L), antimicrosomal antibody was positive at a titre of 1:6400, anti thyroglobulin antibody was positive at 1:1280 but thyroid function tests (TSH 1.69, fT4 13.0) and isotope thyroid scan I123 were normal. Immunoglobulins, C3, C4 and C-reactive protein levels were normal. There was spontaneous regression of her thyroid swelling by December 1996 at which time antimicrosomal antibody was negative. Follow-up for 10 years showed the persistence of lymphocytosis (February 2004-WBC 12.5 × 109/L, absolute lymphocyte count 5.4 × 109/L) without development of autoimmune disease, autoantibodies, neutropenia or infections."
99,491988,684839,337328,"A 35 year old unmarried female patient presented to us with abdominal pain. On examination, a vague mass was palpable in the left lumbar region. The patient had history of excision of bilateral ovarian cystic masses for cystic teratoma twelve years earlier. Computerized tomographic scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a 9 × 7 cm uniformly solid mass with poor contrast enhancement situated in the inferomedial aspect of the left kidney [Fig ]. It was difficult to determine whether the mass was arising from renal parenchyma or renal pelvis. There were no retroperitoneal lymphnodes. Urine cytology, cystoscopy and retrograde ureterography were normal. There was no evidence of distant metastases. The patient also had a pelvic adnexal mass. On abdominal exploration, there was a well defined mass arising from the inferior and anterior aspect of the left renal pelvis, and attached to it with a narrow pedicle. There was no adherence or attachment to the renal parenchyma [Fig ]. The renal pelvis was opened to remove it completely. There was no intrapelvic growth. The part of the renal pelvis (about 1.5 cm) from which the tumor was arising was excised. Frozen section revealed a benign nature. The renal pelvis was closed after inserting a double J stent into left ureter. The left adnexal mass was excised with preservation of uterus and other ovary.
On pathological examination, the tumor was well-defined and capsulated. On cut section it had a firm, whitish solid appearance without areas of necrosis or hemorrhage.
Microscopically, the tumor was composed of large collagenized areas containing bundles of spindle cells. These areas were interspersed with thick walled, blood vessels, fatty tissue and several 'microcysts' lined by cuboidal epithelium [Fig ]. Normal renal parenchyma was not seen. Immunohistochemistry showed strong positivity for SMA and desmin in the spindle cell areas. Cytokeratin (CK) and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) were positive in cells lining the microcysts. Estrogen receptor (ER), Progesterone receptor (PR) and HMB 45 (Human melanoma antibody) were negative. The pelvic adnexal mass was found to be a mature cystic teratoma. After one year of follow up, the patient was well with no adverse effects from the surgery."
100,492225,742926,851130,"A 73 year-old male patient, with a previous PTCA (percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) of the left anterior descending artery and ramus intermedius, underwent a dipyridamole stress testing following a nondiagnostic exercise EKG (the exercise was terminated because of the occurrence of non sustained ventricular tachycardia). The baseline echo revealed an apical hypokinesis () which did not change during the test, however ventricular tachycardia developed again during dipyridamole echo (). Lesson: it is useless to expose a patient with known coronary artery disease and a previously complicated test to another stressor. Indication must be appropriate."
101,492225,445989,353790,"An 81 year-old female, with symptomatic and hemodynamically significant aortic stenosis and normal coronary angiogram underwent a high dose dipyridamole stress echo testing. The baseline wall motion was normal (). The patient fell in cardiogen shock and had a transient ischemic attack of the brain following a negative test (). Lesson: another dangerous experiment on a patient with already diagnosed normal coronary arteries. Indication must be always appropriate."
102,516289,195104,662580,"A 57 year-old male patient with abdominal pain and claudicatio intermittens was studied with dobutamine echocardiography. Soon after the first (5 mcg/Kg/min) dose the patient had ventricular extrasystoles () and during the 20 mcg/Kg/min dose of dobutamine, Torsade de points ventricular tachycardia evolved (). Lesson: in patients with arrhytmias in resting conditions, dobutamine can often provoke dangerous tachycardias. In this group of patients dipyridamole could be the first choice."
103,516289,315077,928425,"A 55 year-old male patient with previous posterior myocardial infarction, quadruple by-pass, depressed left ventricular function and chest pain was sent to the echo lab for assessment of myocardial viability (). Low dose dobutamine echo was performed, however, following the 10 mcg/Kg/min dose a fatal ventricular fibrillation developed (). Lesson: there must always be an attending physician during pharmacological stress echo testing with all necessary equipment for reanimation. Dobutamine can provoke arrhytmias even in low doses."
104,558317,15691,712212,"A 66 year-old male patient with a recent (12 days old) inferior infarction and inferior aneurysm underwent a high dose dobutamine stress test. A huge aneurysm of the inferior wall was present on the baseline echocardiogram (). The patient died following an acute cardiac rupture (). Lesson: indications for testing must always be first class, and in patients with recent infarction and aneurysm dipyridamole should be the first choice."
105,558317,204126,531229,"A 75-year-old female presented with dyspnea. Her past medical history included hypertension and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Other than tachypnea, the cardiorespiratory examination was normal. The 12 lead electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with left atrial enlargement and non-specific T wave changes laterally. Arterial blood whilst breathing 12 litres of oxygen per minute via face mask was taken: pH 7.44, PaCO2 36 mmHg, PaO2 52 mmHg, O2 saturation 88%.
Full blood examination and D-Dimer were normal. A computed tomography pulmonary angiogram was normal. During admission there was fluctuating hypoxia, dyspnea and central cyanosis. An intra-cardiac shunt was suspected. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) showed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy and normal right ventricular function. There was an atrial septal defect (ASD) with an aneurysmal interatrial septum (figure ), and mild left-to-right shunting only. Color flow Doppler across the atrial septum demonstrated multiple fenestrations (figure ). No right-to-left shunting was demonstrable with a saline contrast study, and a Swan Ganz catheter confirmed normal pulmonary artery pressures.
It was noted that her hypoxia was relieved in the recumbent position. On breathing room air whilst supine, the SpO2 was consistently above 90%, however in the sitting position, the SpO2 repeatedly dropped to as low as 70% with worsening dyspnea and development of central cyanosis. A repeat TEE was performed in both the supine and sitting position. At a 70 degree incline, there was significant right-to-left shunting. The aortic root appeared mildly dilated with distortion of the interatrial septum contributing to the shunt. Due to the fenestrated nature of the defect, surgical correction was performed (figures and ). Twelve months later the patient is doing well without recurrence of symptoms."
106,598428,167332,832123,"A 19 year old male was admitted to the department of tuberculosis and chest diseases, with complaints of gradually progressive breathlessness of one week duration along with low grade fever and cough with foul smelling expectoration. Patient was not on any antimicrobial treatment. There was no history of trauma to the chest and his past medical history was unremarkable. He did not have pharyngitis or skin rashes. He was a non-smoker and non-alcoholic and was employed in a tea stall, wherein he handles unpasteurized milk.
Clinical examination and imaging studies revealed a right sided multi-loculated hydropneumothorax (Figure ). Blood peripheral smear, total and differential leukocyte counts were normal. Routine serum biochemical parameters were also within normal limits. ELISA test for HIV was negative.
Therapeutic thoracocentesis yielded 500 ml of thick foul smelling pus and air. Empirical treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole was started. Patient was put on closed chest tube drainage with underwater seal which was removed after one month, in view of significant clinical and radiological improvement (Figure ). Antimicrobial therapy was also continued for the same duration. Patient was then discharged and advised follow-up.
Microscopic observation of the Gram stained smear of the pus showed pleomorphic Gram positive coryneform bacteria. Aerobic culture after 48 hours at 37°C grew minute, translucent, non-pigmented colonies with a small zone of clear hemolysis on 5% sheep blood agar (Figure ). Heavy growth was obtained in pure culture. Upon further incubating the culture plates the colonies increased in size and appeared opaque with enhanced hemolysis. Transmitted light revealed a small dark dot at the centre of each colony. When a colony was gently removed a tiny dark pit was seen in the agar. The isolate did not grow in MacConkey agar. It was non-motile, non-acid fast and did not show any volutin granules. Catalase and urease tests were negative. Glucose and maltose were fermented but not xylose and mannitol. Reverse CAMP (Figure ) and DNAase tests were positive. Gelatin was not liquefied.
Based on the hemolytic pattern, catalase reaction and other biochemical tests the isolate was identified as Arcanobacterium haemolyticum. These tests also differentiate our isolate from the closely related Arcanobacterium pyogenes []. The isolate was found to be sensitive to routinely used antibiotics (Ampicillin, 10 mcg/disc ; erythromycin, 15 mcg/disc ; ceftriaxone, 30 mcg/disc; gentamicin, 10 mcg/disc and ciprofloxacin, 5 mcg/disc) by Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method done on Muller Hinton Agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood."
107,598428,728281,167652,"A 28-year-old man complaining of acute hoarseness and tingling in his left upper and lower extremities was admitted to hospital. His past medical history revealed persistent frontal headache for the last 3 weeks. On admission the patient was nervous and slightly confused. Fever was not present, although the patient complained of flu-like symptoms 4 weeks before. On neurologic examination dysarthria, a left facial weakness, clumsiness in rapid alternating movements of the left hand and dysmetric finger-to-nose testing beside abnormalities in pain and temperature sensation on the left side were found. Cranial computed tomography (CCT) scan was normal. Routine laboratory examinations showed no abnormalities. Serum antibodies to neurotropic viruses, HIV, Treponema pallidum and Borrelia burgdorferi were not found. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contained inflammatory cells (32 lymphocytes/μl) and total CSF protein was elevated (930 mg/l). The glucose ratio was normal. Immunological studies and polymerase chain reactions for herpes simplex virus type 1, 2 and varicella-zoster virus were unobtrusive. Suspecting acute viral meningoencephalitis the patient was treated with aciclovir 3 × 750 mg/d. Within 24 hours after acute onset of focal neurologic symptoms remission of dysarthria was observed while the abnormal sensation and mild agitation were still present. Magnetic resonance (MR) scans performed 24 hours after acute onset of focal symptoms showed disseminated hyperintensities of the supratentorial grey and white matter with predominance in the right occipital region lacking enhancement after GdDTPA-injection (Figure ). The MR-angiography was normal. The characteristics and location of these findings were not typical for acute disseminated encephalomyelitis or herpes simplex encephalitis. The follow-up MR scans showed an increase of white matter hyperintensities with enhancement after GdDTPA-injection. Repeated CSF analyses revealed no new aspects. During the hospital course only subfebrile body temperatures could be registered. Eight days after admission conventional angiography was considered but the patient developed severe disorientation and agitation. Within 12 hours he became unconscious and developed signs of transtentorial herniation. The emergency CCT-scan revealed massive generalized brain edema. Artificial ventilation was necessary. The patient was treated with steroids 2 × 1000 mg/d, but died 10 days after onset of his focal symptoms with signs of extensive brain stem dysfunction.
The postmortem examination revealed primary angiitis of the central nervous system (PACNS) with focal granulomatous inflammation and partially thrombotic occlusion of leptomeningeal and cerebral arteries (Figure ) resulting in multiple acute infarction areas in the cerebrum. There was also a brisk acute hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy with diffuse eosinophilic neuronal injury (particularly in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, Purkinje cell layer, and olivary nucleus) leading to and sustaining a prominent swelling of the brain with terminal herniation and necrosis of the parahippocampal gyrus as well as tonsillar tissue. There was no deposition of amyloid beta protein (Abeta) in the brain parenchyma and vessel walls as revealed by immunohistochemistry for Abeta (6F/3D anti-Aβ monoclonal antibody to residues 8 – 17, dilution1:100, Dako). Outside the dural confines no signs of vasculitis or systemic disease were found."
108,600392,484638,786761,"A 25 year old woman with a seven years history of intravenous drug abuse was admitted to our hospital after 6 days with fever and chills. Her vital signs included a temperature of 39°C, a heart rate of 110 bpm, a blood pressure of 125/70 mmHg. Findings on cardiac examination were unremarkable, as were the results of the remainder of the evaluation. Results of laboratory examinations included a white blood cell count of 12.000 cells/mm3, an erythrocyte sedimentation time of 100 mm and a reactive C protein of 5 mg/100 ml (0.5 upper limit). A set of three peripheral blood culture from different sites were made. A Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed the same day as the patient was admitted to the hospital. A structure due to an eustachian valve was noted in the right atrium. Furthermore a mobile mass of 1.5 cm × 0.8 cm was noted to be attached to the eustachian valve. Another mobile mass of 0.6 cm × 0.8 cm was noted on tricuspid valve (Figure ). A diagnosis of endocarditis on eustachian and tricuspid valve was made. The patient started an empiric antibiotic therapy with oxacillin 12 gr/day ev and netilmicin 300 mg/day ev. After 5 days from admission in the hospital, 3 blood cultures grew methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus. After eight days of persistence of fever a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed to exclude local complication related to infective endocarditis. The TEE confirmed the diagnosis of eustachian and tricuspid valve endocarditis and excluded local complications due to infective endocarditis (Figure ). In the following days the patient became afebrile and was discharged form the hospital in good clinical condition after a 6 weeks course of antibiotic therapy."
109,600392,962794,146227,"A 22 year-old single, Caucasian female Business-school student developed a low fever, headache and sore throat, which remitted spontaneously after three days. Seven days after the start of these symptoms she suddenly became agitated, physically and verbally aggressive, with total insomnia and disrupted behaviour. She was taken by her parents to the Emergency Department of S. Francisco Xavier Hospital, Lisbon, and was compulsorily hospitalised in the acute psychiatric ward under the Portuguese Mental Health Law. The mental state examination revealed a vigil and fully oriented patient. She appeared distrustful, collaborated poorly and was easily distracted. She had false delusional memories and paranoid delusional, poorly structured ideas of persecutory, magical and grandiose content, as well as a disrupted awareness of the boundaries and vitality of the Self. She also claimed, in what appeared to be a delusional misidentification of the Capgras syndrome type, that robots had replaced her parents. She appeared to be suffering complex auditive hallucinations in the 2nd and 3rd person, with a menacing content. Her mood was dysphoric, with poorly contained, labile affects. Her past medical record and family history were irrelevant. Neurological and general physical examinations were normal. She was started on haloperidol 10 mg tid ev (she refused oral medication), with no improvement of her mental state, although she did have unpredictable, short-lived intervals of remarkable lucidity with almost total absence of psychiatric symptoms apart from a depressed mood. 20 days after admission she developed a high fever with a white-cell count of 27 × 109/L, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 100 mm/h and a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 15.3 mg/L. Routine biochemistry studies were normal. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear, with normal protein and glucose concentrations and 20 × 106 lymphocytes per litre. Microbiological investigation of CSF was negative. Her chest film and brain CT-scan showed no changes. Brain MRI showed irregular thickening and nodularity of the lateral ventricles' lining. A complete neuropsychological evaluation was performed revealing a mild impairment of her external visual attention and visuo-constructive reproduction capacity. The EEG displayed symmetrical, irregular, high amplitude, slow wave activity with frontotemporal predominance. An ophthalmologic examination revealed lymphocytes in her vitreum. A skin biopsy was taken for Lupus Band Test, which was negative. Serologic testing of serum and CSF was performed for systemic lupus erythematosus (including anti-ribosomal P antibodies) and other connectivites as well as for most known neurotropic viruses and bacteria. An IgG antibody titer to CP of 22 IU/ml was detected in the serum, with an IgM antibody titer of 85 IU/ml. No anti-CP antibodies were detected in the CSF. All her psychotropic medication was stopped and she was started on levofloxacin (due to dysuria and leukocyturia) and acyclovir. Five days levofloxacin was changed to gentamicin plus piperacillin/tazobactam for due to Escherichia coli-positive blood-cultures (serological results were not yet available at that time). She finally received three consecutive ev pulses of methylprednisolone (1 g each), before being transferred to a Neurology unit. During the following week she progressively became apyretic and her psychotic symptoms gradually remitted. At the time of discharge, eight weeks after admission, she still had an ESR of 55 mm/h and a CRP of 9.03 mg/L, with normal blood count and biochemical parameters as well as a normal CSF. Brain MRI nine weeks after admission showed complete remission of the initial changes. At the time of discharge, the EEG still displayed symmetrical, irregular, high amplitude, slow wave activity with frontotemporal predominance, although much less severe than in the first EEG record.
Psychiatrically she remained slightly disinhibited, both verbally and affectively, with pedolalia and mildly childish behaviour. There were no signs of delusional ideas or hallucinations and she could only vaguely remember the period when she had been psychotic. Two months after discharge she had resumed her studies and concluded her Business School degree."
110,609360,151564,527774,"A 72-year-old Caucasian woman was complaining of bloody stools and constipation for three months. There was a palpable mass 3–4 cm from the anal verge. A colonoscopy showed a tumor 3 cm from the anal margin with no other indication of multiple synchronous tumors in the colon. Biopsies of the tumor were positive for adenocarcinoma. An investigation with upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, computed tomography of chest and abdomen showed cholelithiasis with thickening of gallbladder anterior wall (arrow in the figure ). No evidence of metastatic disease documented. Blood examinations showed anemia (Ht: 28,5% and Hb: 9,5 g/dL) and the rest laboratory evaluation was normal. The carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was: 15,9 ng/ml (range 0,0–10,0). She had a cholecystectomy and abdominoperineal resection of the rectum. The histopathological diagnosis was a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder (T2, N0, M0; stage II) and differentiated moderately adenocarcinoma of the rectum (pT2, N0, M0 in TNM/UICC, stage A of the Dukes staging system and stage B1 of the modified Astler – Coller classification). No adjuvant chemotherapy was required post-operatively. The patient joined a five-year follow up programme and is doing well six months after surgery."
111,609360,587295,951448,"A 42-year-old woman with breast cancer stage IIIB was started on chemotherapy. Four months later, she was admitted with fever, shivering, and painful erythematous lesions disseminated in legs and arms. The patient was initiated on IV vancomycin and amikacin, and after initial blood cultures grew oxacillin-sensitive S. aureus. The catheter was removed and antibiotics were changed to dicloxacillin and amikacin. Initial echo-Doppler for all limbs did not demonstrate obstruction to blood flow. Chest roentgenogram showed bilateral, multiple, rounded, irregular, non-cavitated opacities. Transthoracic echocardiography did not show heart valve vegetations, but did show a mobile hyper-reflectant image in superior vena cava extending to right atrium, suggestive of thrombus. Fever persisted and new painful nodular erythemathous lesions appeared in both limbs that evolved into abscesses, but neither purulent skin lesions nor blood cultures grew microorganisms. A second transthoracic echocardiogram performed 9 days later showed persistence of the same pediculated lesion that measured 40 × 10 × 10 mm. The patient was thrombolyzed with the same doses of streptotokinase; 24 h later, she had no fever, all symptoms resolved and transthoracic echocardiography performed 9 days later showed no lesions. She completed 6 weeks with IV antimicrobials. A month later, the scheduled mastectomy was performed the patient received 11 courses of weekly paclitaxel. Ten months later, the patient is asymptomatic with no evidence of tumor activity."
112,610235,331487,6315,"A 57-year-old woman with ovarian adenocarcinoma stage IV metastatic to lungs with a catheter placed in the right subclavian vein, through which she received four cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxel. One week after the last chemotherapy cycle, she developed fever and pain in the right shoulder and two days later presented to the emergency room. At admission, the patient had persistent shoulder pain, anorexia, and an enlarging, painful mass in right shoulder, with an indurated, extremely tender area in right sternoclavicular joint and edema in right arm. She was febrile, hypotensive, and tachycardic. Oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus grew in blood and catheter tip, and was started on dicloxacillin and amikacin. Echo-Doppler revealed a 4-cm long thrombus within the right subclavian vein partially occluding the right jugular vein. No intracardiac thrombus or valvular lesions were observed in the Echocardiogram. CT scan showed a large collection of liquid in right shoulder sternoclavicular joint. The patient received an initial streptokinase bolus of 250,000 IU and one 12-h infusion of 20,000 U/h, followed by enoxaparin 60 mg BID. Twenty four hours later, Echo-Doppler showed patent right subclavian and jugular veins. She completed 3 weeks of enoxaparin and then changed to oral anticoagulation. Technetium bone scan showed evidence of ipsilateral clavicle osteomyelitis. She received IV antibiotics for 4 weeks followed by oral dicloxacillin plus rifampin for 28 weeks. After treatment the bone scan did not have evidence of osteomyelitis and 8 months later the patient had normal shoulder function without arm edema."
113,610235,478330,544106,"A 51-year-old female presented with a pancreatic mass found incidentally on the abdominal computed tomography for routine health examination. The mass was located in the body of the pancreas and was ill-defined with faint inhomogeneous low density at both the arterial and the venous phases of computerized tomography (CT) scan (Figure ). Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography showed mild indentation and slight irregularity of the neck portion of the main pancreatic duct suggesting extrinsic compression of the main pancreatic duct. The patient underwent distal pancreatectomy.
The sectioned surface of the resected pancreas revealed a non-encapsulated, partially lobulate, whitish gray ovoid firm mass with 2.5 cm in its greatest dimension. The mass was predominantly solid with some cystic spaces, which contained mucinous fluid (Figure ). The mass was not communicated with pancreatic ductal system. Microscopically, the tumor was circumscribed with focal entrapped normal pancreatic acini in the periphery of the tumor. Glandular or small cystic structures were scattered in the predominant stroma, which created the tumor's solid appearance (Figure ). The glands or cysts were lined by a single layer of tall columnar epithelial cells, which revealed basally located nuclei and abundant intracellular mucin that was positively stained on periodic acid Schiff and alcian blue. The subepithelial stroma was cellular and composed of bland looking spindle cells mimicking ovarian stroma (Figure ). The columnar epithelia contained occasional goblet cells and endocrine cells and revealed abundant pseudopyloric metaplasia (Figure ). Some cysts were lined by bland looking polygonal or ovoid stratified cells suggestive of benign transitional epithelia (Figure ). The stroma adjacent to transitional epithelia was hypocellular and densely hyalinized compared to that adjacent to the columnar epithelia. As a whole the stroma was composed of cytologically bland looking spindle cells, which had variable cellularity, areas of extensive stromal hyalinization, no cytologic atypia and no mitoses.
Immunohistochemical studies were performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections by the avidin-biotin peroxidase complex method. The primary antibodies used were as follow as; Pancytokeratin (1:50, AE and AE3, Zymed, San Francisco, USA), high molecular weight cytokeratin (1:100, 34betaE12, DAKO, Denmark), cytokeratin 7 (1:50, OV-TL 12/30, DAKO), cytokeratin 20 (1:40, Ks20.8, DAKO), calretinin (1:50, polyclonal, DAKO), estrogen receptor (1:40, 6F11, Novocastra, Newcastle, UK), progesterone receptor (1:80, 1A6, Novocastra), chromogranin A (1:200, LK2H10 and PHE5, NeoMarker, Fremint, CA, USA), CD34 (1:40, QBEnd 10, DAKO), vimentin (1:50, V-9, Biogenex, san Ramon, CA), α-smooth muscle actin (1:50, α-sm-1, Novocastra, Newcastle, UK), desmin (1:100, D33, DAKO), S-100 protein (1:150, B32.1, Biomeda, Foster city, CA), CD99 (1:100, HO36-1.1, NeoMarker, Fremint, CA), CD99 (1:100, HO36-1.1, Neomarker), c-kit (1:300, 104D2, DAKO). Both mucinous and transitional epithelia were diffusely immunoreactive to pancytokeratin and cytokeratin 7, but not reactive to cytokeratin 20 except for goblet cells. Transitional epithelia were diffusely reactive to high molecular weight cytokeratin (Figure ), whereas mucinous epithelia were not reactive to it. Scattered endocrine cells were highlighted by positive reactivity to chromogranin A (Figure ). The stromal cells were diffusely positive for CD 34 and vimentin, and focally positive for calretinin (Figure ) and progesterone receptor (Figure ), while negative for estrogen receptor, alpha-smooth muscle actin, desmin, c-kit, CD99, S100 protein and cytokeratin."
114,613714,686805,334821,"Our patient was a 78 year old lady who following a total hip replacement developed a pneumothorax and pneumonia and needed post-operative ventilation. She was difficult to wean off the ventilator and on day 7 post-op, we decided to perform a combined open and percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT). Due to the difficult anatomy, we dissected down to the level of the strep muscles before proceeding with PDT technique. The tracheal was easily palpated by this stage. We used a Portex ULTRAperc (Portex Ltd, Hythe, Kent, England) kit, with a size 8.0 mm ID tracheostomy tube. Her tracheal rings were rather calcified and we heard a 'crack' during the dilatation process. Nevertheless, there was no problem with introducing the tracheal tube. The procedure was carried out under guiding vision from within the trachea by flexible video bronchoscopy with no obvious complications noted.
Subsequently this lady failed three attempts at tracheal decannulation. She would develop immediate airway obstruction following tracheostomy tube removal requiring reinsertion of the tracheostomy tube. On day 32 of her ICU stay, following the third attempt, we performed a video endoscopic airway examination. Passing the flexible bronchoscope (Pentax FB-18BS, Pentax Medical, Slough, England) through the larynx, we found a fractured tracheal cartilage ring, protruding into the trachea just above the tracheostomy tube. Then, by passing the flexible bronchoscope through the tracheostomy tube, we saw tracheal wall oedema and inflammation. There was also collapse of the anterior tracheal wall on inspiration demonstrating tracheomalacia. This segment of tracheal wall collapse was quite long as shown by the partial removal of the tracheostomy tube.. [Figure & see video file 1]
She was eventually discharged to a ward environment on day 38 with the tracheostomy tube in situ. Unfortunately she later suffered a cardio-respiratory arrest and the patient died. The post mortem findings were consistent with that of respiratory failure secondary to bronchopneumonia."

There was no history trauma or past history of tuberculosis. On examination, she was moderately built and nourished. General physical examination was normal. She was febrile with a temperature of 99°F (37.2°C). Vital parameters were normal. Neurologically she was conscious, alert and orientated. Cranial nerve examination was normal. There was no papilledema and meningeal signs were absent. She had flaccid areflexic paraplegia with power 0/5 (MRC grade). She had impaired sensations in both lower limbs with a level at T10. Perianal sensations were impaired and she had poor anal tone. Routine haematological parameters revealed a total white blood cell (WBC) count of 13,980/cu mm with neutrophil predominance. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate ESR (Westergreen) was 50 mm in 1 hour. Standard agglutination test (tube) titer was 1:320 and 2-mercaptoethanol agglutination test titer was 1:80. Plain radiograph of lumbosacral spine was normal. MRI scan of the spine showed a lesion in the spinal cord extending from lower part of T12 to L2. It was hyper-intense on T1WI and iso-intense on T2WI There was cord edema extending cranially up to T10 (figure ).
She underwent T11 to L3 laminectomy. The lower end of the cord and the conus medullaris were swollen and the cauda equina nerve roots were pushed to the right side. Myelotomy was done at the conus level. At a depth of about 0.5 cm, purulent fluid was encountered, which was sent immediately for microbiological analysis. Under operating microscope the abscess cavity was visualized through the limited myelotomy (fig ). The abscess was completely evacuated, after which the cord and conus had become lax and pulsating well. Dura was closed completely.
Pus revealed gram-negative bacilli. It was inoculated aerobically [Brucella agar, chocolate and MacConkey media], and anaerobically [Kanamycin-vancomycin laked sheep blood agar (KVLB) and Bacteroides bile esculin agar (BBE)]. Brucella agar and CA were incubated in CO2 jar and after 2 days minute translucent colonies were seen. Gram stain from culture showed gram-negative bacilli. Oxidase, catalase, and urease test were positive. There was no H2S production and it was resistant to dye inhibition. The organism was confirmed as Brucella melitensis [,]. The organism isolated in blood culture taken preoperatively, also was identified as Brucella melitensis.
Postoperatively she had fever, headaches and vomiting lasting for about 1 week. It subsided once antibiotics were instituted. She was started on injection streptomycin 1 gm once a day for 1 month with oral doxycycline 100 mgm twice a day for 1 month. After one month she received oral rifampicin 450 mgm once a day with oral doxycycline 100 mgm twice a day for 1 month. Dexamethasone was given only perioperatively and was rapidly tapered and stopped in the post-operative period. Post operatively she gradually improved in neurological status. At 2-year follow up she had grade 3/5 power in both lower limbs and was mobilising on a wheel chair. The urinary symptoms did not resolve and she continues to be on Foley catheter. She refused a repeat MRI scan, as she could not afford it."
116,616491,848685,264091,"In February 2003, a 61-year-old white female with a history of partial gastrectomy due to a peptic ulcer, and mastectomy due to breast cancer twenty years before, presented with an indolent erythematous mass on her left hard palate and attached gingiva. Her dentist had originally diagnosed periodontal disease, and she was unsuccessfully treated with antibiotics and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; she subsequently also underwent otolaryngological and radiological examinations of the mouth, but both were negative.
In September 2003, a hard palate biopsy led to a histopathological diagnosis of a chorion metastasis from a breast adenocarcinoma, but the results of subsequent mammography, abdominal ultrasound, chest X-ray and neoplastic marker analyses did not reveal any evidence of a tumour. One month later, a second hard palate biopsy revealed an undifferentiated carcinoma with a focal microglandular and diffuse signet-ring cell growth infiltrating the subepithelial chorion mucosa consistent with a gastric origin (Fig. ). Although the patient was asymptomatic, gastroscopy showed an ulcerated lesion of the greater curvature of the stomach, and histopathogy revealed an undifferentiated gastric carcinoma with signet-ring cells (Fig. ).
She was admitted to our Institution in October 2003, when a physical examination revealed left supraclavicular adenopathy, left exophthalmus, and a firm and painless erythematous mass of nearly 4 cm on her left hard palate, with no evidence of bleeding at palpation (Fig. ). She was negative for neoplastic markers, and denied any weight loss or gastrointestinal symptoms during the previous weeks. The results of chest and abdominal CT scans were negative, but magnetic resonance imaging of the maxilla revealed an enhanced 2.7 × 2.3 cm lesion on the left hard palate, with thickening of the genal mucosa and no bone involvement (Fig. ).
A review of the slides of both the oral and gastric lesions confirmed the diagnosis of a mucosal metastasis from a gastric carcinoma, and so the patient underwent five courses of chemotherapy for six months, followed by concomitant 30 Gy radiotherapy of the oral cavity. Because the oral lesion was clinically stable after radiotherapy and was the only sign of distant neoplastic disease, the patient underwent laparotomy with total gastrectomy and regional lymphadenectomy in April 2004. No other macroscopic localizations were found in the abdominal cavity. This curative decision was taken in an attempt to improve the prognosis with the aim of subsequently extirpating the only oral metastasis.
Histopathological examination of the resected specimens revealed a mixed undifferentiated signet-ring cell and microglandular carcinoma infiltrating the gastric wall, with metastases in all of the visceral lymph nodes, and moderate vascular invasion by neoplastic cells. The resected margins were tumour free.
Unfortunately, the patient's condition deteriorated rapidly and she died of heart failure a few days later.
The post-mortem examination demonstrated residual bilateral ovarian infiltration by an undifferentiated signet-ring cell carcinoma (Krukenberg's tumour), with no other abdominal or thoracic localizations."
117,616491,544255,350898,"A 41-year-old gentleman was referred to the otolaryngology outpatient clinic with a one-month history of acute right-sided hearing loss. At the time of onset, he noticed a sudden loss of hearing in his right ear immediately following the prolonged use of a pneumatic drill on concrete without the benefit of ear protection. There was no previous history of noise exposure or any ear problems.
Assessment of the right tympanic membrane revealed a retraction pocket in the attic containing dry cholesteatoma with the suspicion of the cholesteatoma passing postero-inferiorly. His left tympanic membrane was normal at otoscopy. Weber testing lateralised to the right side and Rinne's test was negative on the right using a 512Hz tuning fork. The rest of the examination was unremarkable. Pure tone audiometry confirmed a 45-decibel mean conductive hearing loss on the right (Figure ) with normal hearing levels in the left ear.
He subsequently underwent a right tympanomastoidectomy and ossiculoplasty. Operative findings confirmed extensive erosion and fracture of the long process of incus (LPI) by a moderate size cholesteatoma. The stapes footplate was mobile. Following careful dissection and removal of the entire cholesteatoma together with the head of the malleus, ossicular continuity was restored with a Goldenberg partial ossicular replacement prosthesis connecting the stapes suprastructure to the handle of malleus. A repeat audiogram 7 weeks post-surgery showed a 15-decibel improvement in his right ear (Figure ). The patient went on to make a good recovery with no recurrence of cholesteatoma at 12 months with good hearing thresholds"
118,627644,426360,831722,"A 61 year-old male was admitted for constipation and a palpable mass in the periumbilical area. His medical history revealed the surgery for acute perforative appendicitis 20 years ago and occasional intestinal obstruction afterwards. He denied any history of radiation or occupational exposure to chemicals. The small bowel series showed an external compressive lesion in the distal ileum and the computerized tomographic (CT) scan revealed a 6 cm, well-marginated mass in the anteromedial aspect of the ascending colon (Figure ). Under the suspicion of foreign body granuloma due to gauze (gossypibioma), an exploratory laparotomy was performed. The whole intestine was found to be covered in severe adhesion; however, ascites or blood in the abdominal cavity was absent. In the anteromedial aspect of ascending colon, there was an encapsulated mass 5 cm in size, and it was adhered to ascending colon and distal ileum (Figure ). The mass was filled with abscess and granulation tissue, and the frozen biopsy reported the diagnosis of abscess. Only resection of the mass was performed, and the patient was discharged without any complications.
Forty days after the discharge, he was admitted again with anemia, abdominal distension, and melana. The colonoscopy revealed the hematoma and the stenosis of the lumen directly above the cecum. The abdominal CT scan showed large volume of blood in the abdomen and multiple peritoneal nodules. The angiography and 99 mTc labeled RBC scan showed active bleeding around the ileocecal valve. Emergent laparotomy was performed and multiple nodules were found on the wall of ileum, liver, mesentery and peritoneum. In the distal ileum, two nodular lesions with 3 cm and 2 cm in size were bleeding actively, and they were adhered to each other. The nodules were diagnosed as sarcoma through the frozen biopsy, and the distal ileum including the pathologic lesion was resected. Seven days later, reoperation was performed due to substantial hemorrhage from the peritoneum, the mesentery, and the small intestine wall. Two days after the last surgery, the patient expired of uncontrollable bleeding due to disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.
On the macroscopic examination of resected ileum, there were two ill-defined tan solid tumors with mucosal ulceration, each measured 3 × 1.5 cm and 2 cm in diameter, involving the entire intestinal wall and extending to the subserosa of adhered loop. (Figure ).
Under microscope, spindle-shaped or epithelioid cells were arranged as a plate and the rudimentary vessel lumen were detected occasionally (Figure ). Separated from these two lesions, several small angiosarcomas containing foreign body granulomas were found in the subserosal layer of the intestine. Also, the nodules of liver and mesentery were diagnosed as metastatic angiosarcomas.
Immunohistochemical staining was performed and tumor cells were positive for CD31, CD34, and vimentin (Figure ), whereas negative for factor antigen, CD117, and S-100. The tumor cells were also negative for cytokeratin (AE1/3) and EMA. The foreign body granulomas were surrounded by CD31 positive cells, partially or entirely.
The previously resected mass, which was diagnosed as abscess, was reviewed. In a low magnification field, abscess in the center and fibrosis with vascular proliferation in the periphery were noted (Figure ). However, when the periphery was examined under the high magnification, spindle-shaped or epithelioid cells were arranged as plate patterns, in some area, well-differentiated vessels were formed as similar to the lesions from the ileum. The additional serial sections revealed more foreign materials surrounded by epithelioid tumor cells and the invasion of tumor cells to the blood vessel. The tumor cells were positive for CD31 and CD34, and negative for cytokeratin. This supported the final diagnosis of a foreign body granuloma associated-angiosarcoma."
119,627644,569145,366055,"On May 8, 2004, a 51-year-old man living in Barcellona Pozzo di Gotto, Messina, Sicily, Italy was admitted to the hospital with a 3-month fever (37.2°C), arthralgia, myalgia, malaise, pallor, stiffnes of hands and knee, nausea, low appetite and weight loss. The patient did not recall a tick bite but he visited hunting areas 15 days before the fever started and kept exotic birds (golden pheasants, partridges and guinea fowls) at his house for two years. The patient showed abnormal liver (462 mU/ml alkaline phosphatase, normal range (nr) = 98–280; 1.20 mg/dl total bilirubin, nr = 0.16–1.10; 0.35 mg/dl direct bilirubin, nr = 0.0–0.2) and renal (1.5 mg/dl creatinine, nr = 0.5–1.2) functions and low hemoglobin (9.9 g/dl; nr = 12–18). Pulmonary, cardiac and immunological involvement was absent. Cell counts and serum C-reactive protein levels were normal.
On September 13, 2004 the patient was admitted to the hospital for a second time. In addition to previous findings, the patient showed a mild splenomegaly, hemorrhoids, osteopenia, hiatal hernia, gastritis and inflammation of duodenum. Systemic inflammatory pathology and neoplasia were ruled out. Doctors suspected a depressive syndrome and the patient was treated with antidepressants.
Serum antibodies were determined for Lyme borreliosis, Rickettsia conorii, Coxiella burnetii and A. phagocytophilum (Fuller Laboratories, Fullerton, CA, USA), and Ehrlichia chaffeensis and A. phagocytophilum (Focus Technologies, Cypress, CA, USA) following manufacturer's recommendations. FITC-conjugated anti-human IgG (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and IgM (Aliphadia S.A., Wavre, Belgium) were used as secondary antibodies. The immunofluorescence tests for A. phagocytophilum use antigens derived from human HL-60 cells infected with the HGE-1 isolate and samples were considered negative when no fluoresce was detected at 1:80 (Fuller Laboratories) or 1:64 (Focus Technologies) dilution of the test serum, as recommended by the manufacturer. DNA was purified using GenElute Mammalian Genomic DNA Miniprep Kit (Sigma) or TriReagent (Sigma) from patient's blood samples collected in September 8 and October 8, 2004. PCR analysis for R. conorii, C. burnetii, E. chaffeensis, Theileria spp., Babesia spp. and Anaplasma spp. were conducted on both DNA samples as previously described [-]. PCRs were conducted with 1 μl (0.1–10 ng) DNA using 10 pmol of each primer in a 50-μl volume (1.5 mM MgSO4, 0.2 mM dNTP, 1 × AMV/Tfl 5 × reaction buffer, 5u Tfl DNA polymerase) employing the Access RT-PCR system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Reactions were performed in an automated DNA thermal cycler for 35 cycles. PCR products were electrophoresed on 1% agarose gels to check the size of amplified fragments by comparison to a DNA molecular weight marker (1 Kb DNA Ladder, Promega). Control reactions were done without the addition of DNA to rule out contaminations during PCR.
Amplified Anaplasma 16S rDNA fragments were resin purified (Wizard, Promega) and cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega) for sequencing both strands by double-stranded dye-termination cycle sequencing (Core Sequencing Facility, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Noble Research Center, Oklahoma State University). Two independent clones were sequenced from each PCR. Multiple sequence alignment was performed with the program AlignX (Vector NTI Suite, version 5.5; InforMax, North Bethesda, MD, USA)."
120,631439,551704,676585,"A 26 year old male was admitted with impaired hearing and tinnitus on the right side and swelling of the right temporal region which was gradually progressive for the last two years. His general physical examination was normal. Neurological examination revealed a severe right conductive hearing loss with a Grade II House-Brackman facial nerve paresis. A diffuse swelling was noted in the right temporal and preauricular region. CT scan of the brain showed a large well defined hyperdense contrast enhancing lesion originating from the right temporal bone – squamous and petrous portions with a large intracranial extension causing uncal herniation [Fig. &].
The patient was taken up for surgery with an intention of radical removal. Control of the right external carotid artery (ECA) was obtained in the neck [Fig. inset]. Right frontotemporal scalp flap was raised. The temporalis muscle was seen to be infiltrated by the tumor and was excised seperately. The tumor was firm, reddish brown and vascular. It had destroyed the squamous temporal bone, lateral petrous portion, zygomatic arch and was seen invading the cranium pushing the temporal bone superiorly and medially along with the dura [Fig. ]. Dura was not transgressed. Piecemeal total removal of the tumor was achieved with temporary clamping of the right ECA. The tumor was adherent to the dura but could be peeled off the dura [Fig. ]. Biopsy was taken from surrounding bone, muscle and dura from 4 different sites. A drain was left in the large dead space created by the removal of the tumor. Cranioplasty was planned for a later date.
Postoperatively the patient developed a right total LMN VII nerve palsy (Grade VI House-Brackman). Hence a right tarsorrhaphy was done to prevent exposure keratitis one week after the first operation. At the same sitting the external auditory canal was also closed to prevent communication of the dead space in the cranium with the external auditory canal after confirming the absence of any collection in the intracranial dead space. The postoperative period was otherwise uneventful. Histopathological examination revealed a neoplasm composed of numerous osteoclast like giant cells amidst a background of mononuclear plump spindle cells suggestive of a GCT [Fig. ]. The histopathological examination of the other 4 areas of bone, dura and muscle did not reveal any tumor infiltration. Postoperative CT scan confirmed a total excision of the tumor [Fig. ]. Since a radical excision of the tumor had been achieved it was decided to defer radiotherapy. Three months after surgery patient was normal but for the deafness and facial palsy. Follow up CT at 6 months and 12 months did not reveal any recurrence.
Neoplasia of the skull bones are uncommon accounting for only 2.4% – 2.6% of all primary bone tumors []. The majority of giant cell tumors occur in the long bones usually the distal femur, proximal tibia and fibula, distal radius and ulna []. The skull is a rare location for GCT. In the cranium the sphenoid bone is the commonest site followed by the temporal bone [,-]. This can be explained by the fact that the tumor genesis occurs in the endochondral bone instead of intramembranous bone [,-]. The temporal bone has two main components – squamous and petromastoid. The squamous portion develops by intramembranous ossification, while the petreomastoid portion develops from cartilage (endochondral bone). GCTs are commonly seen to arise from the petromastoid portion as was noted in the present case. GCT is commonly seen in the 30–50 years age group with only 16% of patients below 20 years of age [,]. A mild female preponderance is seen but this is more pronounced in the younger age group []. Typically, the tumor presents as an enlarging mass associated with local pain over a period of few weeks to years []. GCT of the sphenoid may present with headache, visual field defects, blindness, diplopia, second through eighth cranial nerve dysfunction, endocrinopathy and change of mental status []. Temporal bone tumors present with pain usually behind the affected ear, deafness and facial weakness as in the present case []. Temporal bone GCT may invade the infratemporal fossa, paranasal sinuses and nasopharynx []. Intracranial extension as in our case may also be present. Dural penetration with invasion into the brain has also been seen [,]. Plain radiography shows radiolucent lesion of the skull and cannot be generally differentiated from other radiolucent lesions. On CT it is seen as a lytic lesion expanding the bony cortex []. Generally these tumors are contrast enhancing due to their vascular nature as seen in our patient.
These tumors generally tend to expand and attenuate the bony cortex rather than erode it []. GCT may be vascular and an external carotid angiogram may be required to demonstrate the arterial supply. In our patient the tumor was vascular but no angiogram was performed. However, temporary clamping of the external carotid artery during excision reduced the intraoperative bleeding. Grossly, these tumors are grey to yellow-brown, soft or firm and friable. Small cystic areas and grey-white necrotic foci may be seen. Microscopically, GCT consists of plump spindle shaped or ovoid cells with admixed multinucleated, cytologically benign giant cells. Variable numbers of benign multinucleated cells are seen amidst sheets of benign mononuclear spindle shaped cells with similar nuclear features. The nuclei are generally hypochromatic with inconspicuous nucleoli and mitotic figures are uncommon []. Histological differentiation of GCT may be challenging. The differential diagnoses consist of central giant cell granuloma (CGCG), aneurysmal bone cyst, chondroblastoma, hyperparathyroidism and fibrous dysplasia []. CGCG is a reactive bone lesion that occurs mainly in the jaws []. CGCG and GCT are histologically very similar and the main significant difference is the greater number of nuclei in the giant cells of the GCT [,]. CGCGs are distinguished from true GCTs by their fibrogenic, relatively acellular stroma, extensive osseous metaplasia and the clustering of giant cells around areas of hemorrhage or necrosis []. A key point in the differential diagnosis is that in GCT the stromal cells and giant cells resemble each other particularly with regard to their nuclei, whereas in giant cell reparative granuloma, the osteoclasts and the stromal cells of the fibroblastic type are distinctly different []. Jaffe has subclassified GCT into three grades but such a grading has not been found to correlate with subsequent tumor behaviour or sarcomatous transformation [,].
The precise ontogeny of GCT is unresolved. GCT and CGCG are histologically and pathogenetically similar []. Cell cycle associated proteins like MDM2, Ki-67 and PCNA have been seen to be widely expressed in CGCG and GCT. The percentage of Ki-67 and PCNA positive cells are higher in CGCG[]. This means that CGCGs show a higher proliferative activity than GCTs. GCT cells are also seen to produce both MMP-9 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) []. Studies suggest that TNF-alpha secreted by the multinucleated giant cells up-regulates MMP-9 expression in GCT stromal cells by the induction of certain transcription factors, which in turn enhanced the rate of transcription of MMP-9 gene. An essential cell-cell interaction in the regulation of MMP-9 expression exists in GCT []. Although it is the giant cell which is the most prominent feature of these lesions it is the mononuclear spindle cell which is the proliferating cell. Several pathways to induce osteoclast like giant cell formation from monocytes have been reported. The spindle cell recruits monocytes and induces them to differentiate into osteoclastic giant cells through release of cytokines [,]. Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B (RANK) ligand is also reported to play a crucial role in osteoclastic cell genesis [-]. It is possible that the soluble RANKL is released from the tumor derived cells and the soluble factor interacts with RANK expressed in monocytes resulting in osteoclast-like cell formation in cooperation with macrophage colony stimulating factor secreted from the cells []. SDF-1 has also been incriminated as one of the significant chemo-attractant factors involved in the recruitment of hematopoietic osteoclast precursor cells during tumor-induced osteoclastogenesis []. The histopathogenesis of GCT and CGCG thus appears to be identical but the biological and clinical behavior of GCT is more aggressive than the latter.
The treatment of choice is complete surgical excision which if achieved can be curative [,,]. However the skull base location of these tumors can make total surgical excision hazardous and not possible [,]. The role of adjuvant radiotherapy in eliminating residual tumor tissue is controversial. Some authors claim that GCT is not radiosensitive and radiation may provoke a sarcomatous transformation in the residual tumor tissue [,]. However, other authors recommend a single course of moderate dose super voltage radiation in achieving a high success rate and at the same time lowering the likelihood of malignant transformation [-,]. Radiotherapy remains the only option for unresectable tumors. In our patient radiotherapy was deferred for the present as radical surgical excision was achieved with no residual tumor.
Treatment of GCT and CGCG with calcitonin and osteoprotegrin has received attention. Osteoclasts express calcitonin receptors and can be inhibited by calcitonin. In GCT and CGCG, tumor giant cells and their precursors also express calcitonin receptors. Clinical studies on treatment of CGCG with calcitonin have shown positive results probably due to control of osteoclastogenesis []. Osteoprotegrin ligand was also selectively overexpressed in GCTs and may indicate another possible target to which antitumor therapy could be directed []. Osteoprotegrin influences osteoclastogenesis and may be used for the treatment of GCT and CGCG. Osteoprotegrin is a ""decoy"" receptor for RANKL and therefore inhibits the RANK-RANKL interaction, which is a necessary step in the osteoclastogenesis. This is the rationale for a probable therapeutic use of Osteoprotegrin. Its utility is however unproven [].
GCT can recur especially where only a curettage is employed [,]. Prosser et al recommend primary curettage for intraosseous giant-cell tumors without adjuvant treatment or filling agents, but tumors with soft tissue extension or with local recurrence require more aggressive treatment []. Metastases occur in only 2% of cases and are usually to the lungs but spread to rare areas like lymph nodes, mediastinum, skin, scalp and pelvis has been reported [,]. Our patient is on regular clinical follow up every 3 months and 6 monthly CT scan. He is recurrence free at the end of 12 months."
121,631439,717265,538228,"A 48 year-old African American male presented to our hospital with a four-day history of severe right flank pain starting several hours after smoking cocaine. His pain was associated with subjective fevers, nausea and vomiting. There was no gross hematuria or dysuria. His blood pressure was 140/78 mmHg, heart rate 130 beats per minute, temperature 39.5 °C, respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute and his oxygen saturation was 98% on room air. Pertinent exam findings included severe right costovertebral angle tenderness, diffuse right-sided abdominal pain and a positive psoas sign on the right. Laboratory data showed a white blood cell count of 14 × 109/L (76% neutrophils), serum creatinine 1.4 mg/dL (124 μmol/L), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 704 U/L and serum creatinine kinase (CPK) 259 U/L. A urinalysis showed 3+ proteinuria, 1 to 3 red blood cells per high power field and no white blood cells or casts. Urine toxicology confirmed the presence of cocaine. A Computerized Tomography (CT) scan with contrast revealed a sharply-demarcated heterogenous area of focal decreased enhancement in the anterior right kidney consistent with renal infarct, but pyelonephritis could not be completely ruled out (figure ). Volume-rendered Single Photon Emission-Computed Tomography (SPECT) image of a gallium scan showed no evidence of tracer localization in the right kidney to suggest an infection. It did reveal absence of tracer localization in the upper pole of the right kidney suggesting absence of perfusion to that area (figure ). Blood and urine cultures were negative. A trans-thoracic and a subsequent trans-esophageal echocardiogram showed no evidence of intra-cardiac thrombus or valvular vegetations. Further screening tests for hypercoagulability (factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene, protein C and protein S, anti-thrombin III, anti-phospholipid antibody and homocysteine); collagen vascular disease (rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody); and lipid disorders were within normal limits. Our patient was then diagnosed with CIRI by exclusion."
122,632514,166125,241039,"The third patient was a slightly apprehensive 29-year-old Caucasian male with right-sided diffuse anterior and superior shoulder pain. The pain started gradually over an 8–10 week period, with the intensity being most prevalent during the 2 weeks prior to presentation. The patient was employed as a factory worker; a job that required combined repetitive shoulder movements and periods of administrative keyboard work.
The pain was described as a constant, deep, dull and nagging ache with an intensity of 5/10 (VAS scale). No neurological symptoms were reported, there were no dermatomal/sclerotomal pain referral patterns, although a slight diffuse aching sensation was mentioned in the right elbow and more prominently right ""military badge"" area. Together with the shoulder pain the patient reported a less intense (4/10) dull sensation specifically at the base of the cervical spine on the right and a vague headache like sensation at the base of the skull.
The right shoulder felt subjectively weaker with inability to lift the arm above shoulder level without pain. The pain was aggravated by specific arm postures and lying on the right side. There was no pertinent medical/family/social history.
Examination revealed a painful arc with onset of pain at 70 degrees abduction, external rotation being restricted at 70 degrees with a catching sensation at the end of motion. Reproduction of the pain was elicited with a Hawkins test and on supraspinatus muscle testing (""Empty can"" test) revealing a grade 4 weakness and pain. Other routine shoulder tests revealed no abnormal findings.
Right cervical rotation restriction (65 degrees) was noted on the right, with a right Kemps joint stress test (combined right cervical rotation, lateral flexion and extension) reproducing the low cervical pain but no shoulder pain.
Palpation revealed muscle tenderness in the right supraspinatus, upper trapezius, levator scapulae and infraspinatus muscle groups. A trigger point was palpated in the infraspinatus muscle, which upon applying pressure reproduced the right upper arm diffuse ache. Palpating the rotator cuff insertion on the humerus and coracoacromial ligament caused significant tenderness. Motion palpation revealed likely joint restriction at the right C5/6 cervical facet joint, T2/3 and acromio-clavicular joint. Of interest was the postural presentation of a ""rounded shoulder"" and increased thoracic kyphosis.
A likely primary working diagnosis of a Grade ll Primary Rotator Cuff Impingement (Neer classification-Table []) with Supraspinatus tendonosis was determined, with secondary involvement of the cervical and thoracic spines."
123,632514,999884,590240,"The fourth patient presenting was a 40-year-old Caucasian female. She presented with right-sided anterior shoulder pain, which was nagging, aching and accompanied by a catching sensation on specific movements. The aching pain was constant with an intensity of 6.5/10 (VAS scale), while the catching pain was slightly more intense at 8/10. No neurological sensations were reported. The patient reported a diffuse aching pain in the posterior aspect of the shoulder over the scapula. Nothing relieved the pain, while arm elevation, driving, prolonged sitting behind the computer and poor posture made the pain worse.
The pain started 4 days prior to presentation after spending most of the weekend cleaning the walls at home with a sponge prior to painting. The patient had not had this pain before although due to her work (accountant) she often complains of posterior shoulder tension. The patient had been treated previously for an unrelated complaint (right sided sacroiliac area pain). The medical, family and social histories were unremarkable.
The physical examination revealed restriction in external rotation (60 degrees), and abduction with pain/catching at 90 degrees. Internal rotation was also tight and sore especially with the Hawkins test. The impingement sign was present with reproduction of the anterior pain with a Hawkins and Neers test.
Scapula dysfunction was also noted with a positive right-sided lateral glide test. It should be noted that no major difference was seen with the lateral glide test on the previous 3 patients.
Of importance was the postural presentation of anteriorly rotated shoulders, increased thoracic kyphosis and forward head carriage. A scoliotic curve was also noted with an apex convex to the right in the mid thoracic region. Palpation revealed muscle spasm in the right posterior shoulder girdle muscles with increased muscular tension and sensitivity to palpation in the right supraspinatus and infraspinatus compared to the left. Infraspinatus palpation revealed local muscle spasm with a reproduction of the posterior ache on specific pressure. Increased tenderness was noted whilst palpating the coracoacromial ligament and supraspinatus insertion on the humerus. Specific joint motion palpation revealed likely restriction in the right C5/6 joint, T3/4 and acromioclavicular joint.
A likely working diagnosis of a Grade ll, Primary Shoulder Rotator Cuff Impingement (Neer classification- refer to Table []) was determined. Of note was the secondary contribution of the scapula to this process. The working diagnosis also included the presence an active infraspinatus myofascial pain syndrome.
The 4 patients were admitted to a multimodal treatment protocol, which included the following interventions: soft tissue therapy, ultrasound phonophoresis, manipulation and exercise.
All of the patients received soft tissue therapy that involved the application of ischaemic pressure to the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles, as well as the rhomboids, upper trapezius and levator scapulae. The application involved palpating the muscle bellies and applying a sustained pressure into areas of muscle spasm until a release of the barrier of resistance was felt. Release meaning the relaxation of the point of muscle spasm with a decrease in the sensitivity and muscle tone after re-palpating the area. The pressure was applied repetitively, using a myofascial T-bar (a plastic, T shaped hand held tool with a rubber tip attached to the end in contact with the skin). Care was taken not to cause increased discomfort to the patient (to the level of pain tolerance).
Longitudinal and transverse friction massage was applied to the posterior tenomuscular junction of the infraspinatus muscle, the coracoacromial ligament (postero-inferior aspect) and the insertion of the supraspinatus on the greater tuberosity of the humerus. The friction massage application was achieved by palpating the capsular or tendinous adhesions and frictioning over its surface with the practitioner's index finger. This was maintained until friction anaesthesia was achieved and the patient could not feel any discomfort. A new point was then chosen and the process repeated. Once again care was taken to not cause excessive discomfort to the patient. At the end of the treatment sessions ice application was advised at a frequency of three applications of 15 minutes with two 20-minute breaks.
Ultrasound phonophoresis was applied to the areas that previously underwent friction massage with a topical corticosteroid [1% sigmacort]. Ultrasound was applied with a continuous wave form for 7 minutes at a setting of 2.2 W/cm2 to the rotator cuff insertion on the anterior-inferior aspect of the humerus and posterior inferior aspect of the acromioclavicular joint.
Peripheral thrust manual manipulation was applied to the glenohumeral joints in external rotation (progressive) and inferiorly to the acromioclavicular joint and anterior to posterior to the sternoclavicular joint in all of the patients where a likely motion restriction was detected.
Mechanically assisted manipulations were also used with the Activator 2 apparatus in humeral external rotation or inferior through the AC joint. This particular technique was chosen for one of the female patients (fourth patient as an alternative) who expressed concern with peripheral manual manipulation after the first treatment session as an alternative technique.
Diversified spinal manipulations were used to manipulate the thoracic and cervical spines at the level of T3/4 and C5/6. All patients were given a basic exercise program with initial emphasis on isometric strengthening of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles. This was implemented once a reduction in pain and improved range of motion was noted at a frequency of 4 sets of 10 repetitions, 2–3 times per day. Theraband (extendable elastic) exercises were also implemented at the same frequency after the initial isometric strengthening period. This also included shoulder shrugs, wall push-ups and scapula retraction exercises."

The smears showed numerous cells, predominantly epithelioid-looking, forming slightly cohesive groups, as well as isolated polygonal cells with cytoplasmic elongations and nuclei with acidophilic macronucleoli and pseudoinclusions. Scant cells with melanotic pigment were identified.
Immunohistochemistry was performed, with the following results: negative for cytokeratin, positive for vimentin, S-100 protein, and HMB45. A metastatic melanoma was diagnosed. Fig.
A 55-year-old woman who was diagnosed with a granulosa cell tumor of the ovary with sarcomatous differentiation a year prior to her admission, at present she shows several fastgrowing nodular tumors in both breasts, as well as imaging suggesting metastasis to the liver. FNAB of both breasts was performed.
The smears showed numerous neoplastic cells, predominantly spindle-shaped cells forming small groups, intermingled with other pleomorphic and isolated polygonal cells with large nuclei and no nucleoli. Immunohistochemistry was negative for cytokeratin and CA 15-3, and positive for vimentin. A metastatic sarcoma was diagnosed. Fig ."
125,634917,118717,531118,"A 50-year-old male railroad worker presented to his primary care physician with an erythematous, tender skin lesion on the anteromedial aspect of the right knee. The patient reported that the lesion had been present and intermittently tender over several years prior to presentation. The lesion was initially thought to be a simple cyst and was aspirated by the treating physician; antibiotics were also prescribed. The lesion did not resolve and was subsequently biopsied, revealing squamous cell carcinoma in situ ( and ).
The patient was referred to a surgeon; a definitive excision was performed, with subsequent completion of postoperative localized radiation therapy. The lesion did not recur.
The patient gave a history of having worked for a railroad company for 30 years before noting the skin lesion; most of this time had been spent on the “building and bridges” unit. This work involved the replacement of railroad track ties and the repair and construction of bridges and trestles, all of which involved the use of, and nearly daily handling of, coal tar creosote–treated ties and lumber. He reported that on a nearly daily basis, he carried, handled, kneeled on, or sat on this treated lumber. He also reported that the ties and timbers were heavily coated with creosote and that creosote commonly coated his work clothes at the end of his work shifts. He gave a history of wearing overalls, leather work-gloves, and long sleeves for a majority of his time at work. He stated that, despite wearing protective work clothes, he generally found creosote that had “filtered through” his clothing, particularly on his hands, wrists, and knees, and that he noticed this discoloration on his hands and knees at the end of most workdays. He was not aware of any other rashes or skin changes related to the exposures in these areas.
He had no history of other occupational exposures and reported having no significant sun exposure to the area of the lesion. He had no personal or family history of other skin disease or skin cancers. He was otherwise healthy, was a lifelong nonsmoker, and had no other significant medical history.
The physical examination revealed a healthy-appearing 50-year-old male with no medical concerns other than the skin lesion. Physical findings were unremarkable, with the exception of a well-healed 2-cm scar on the anteromedial aspect of the right knee (the focus of medial pressure upon kneeling). There were no other pertinent skin findings."
126,640135,275683,941168,"In January 1998, AMF, a 55-year-old right-handed female, was attended at the emergency room in the Hospital de Poniente (Almería, Spain) after accidentally drinking a glass of methomyl, a carbamate pesticide. This compound had been prepared by her son and kept in the refrigerator in a bottle for later use in the greenhouse. AMF drank a glass, thinking it was a refreshment. Half an hour later, she was taken to the hospital by her husband, suffering from physical discomfort. Upon the arrival at the emergency room, she presented a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) of 15, and her symptoms included perspiration, tremors, myosis, respiratory problems, sialorrhea, and vomiting. The patient did not present hypoxia, coma, or loss of consciousness [butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) levels shown in ]. She was treated in the hospital with gastric lavage, activated charcoal, cathartics, and antiemetics. She was released 1 week later without further medical treatment. No neurological or physical disturbances were observed. Once at home, she reported slowness, subtle disorientation, and attention and memory problems in daily activities, such as recalling telephone numbers or cooking.
A year later in a medical follow-up visit, she reported that she felt well: Orientation and speed had improved, as had competency in routine abilities such as cooking, but memory problems remained. No other physical problems were recorded. The brain computed tomography (CT) done at this time was considered normal.
AMF underwent a broad-based clinical neuropsychological examination in April 1998 and April 1999. For some of the tests [Logical Memory test and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning tests ()], an alternative form was used in the second evaluation, to avoid effects of learning and practice. During the interview, AMF reported a low level of education, not having finished obligatory primary school. Her primary role was as a housewife, managing money and the home, raising her children, and sometimes helping in agricultural work. Her estimated IQ was 95 (), and her corrected score on the Mini Mental State Examination () was 28, indicating the absence of dementia. She adequately performed tests of single-word reading, basic written arithmetic, and semantic knowledge. Her writing skills were not evaluated, except for her name. Each outcome was evaluated in relation to her educational level, sex, estimated IQ, and age, bearing in mind that the variable “education” has an influence on an individual’s overall neuropsychological performance.
In the first assessment, her performance was below expectation for her estimated pre-morbid IQ in the domains of attention, memory, motor skill, and constructional abilities (). A minimal depression was also registered."
127,640135,976614,372366,"PVM, a 26-year-old right-handed male, was most recently poisoned (February 1998) by a mixture of pesticides [carbamate (methomyl) and pyrethroid (cypermethrin)] while spraying in a greenhouse without any personal safety equipment. PVM attended the emergency room at the Hospital de Poniente (Almería, Spain) because of cephalalgia, abdominal pain, and vomiting. His GCS was 15 (BuChE levels shown in ). He was given a 2-week prescription for atropine (1.2 mg) and antiemetics and was released the next day. He had been poisoned with OPs and carbamates six times previously (all due to the absence of personal safety equipment), with three of them documented. The first took place in June 1996 while he was spraying with methomyl; upon arrival at the hospital, his symptoms were dizziness and perspiration. The second happened in September 1996 while he was working with a mixture of methomyl and chlorpyrifos (OP); in addition to cholinesterase inhibition, the patient showed tremors, perspiration, respiratory problems, sialorrhea, and vomiting. The third documented poisoning event happened in December 1996 when he was spraying with a mixture of methomyl and chlorpyrifos; his symptoms were vomiting, myosis, abdominal pain, perspiration, and respiratory problems. In these four events, the medical diagnosis was overcholinergic syndrome. No coma, hypoxia, or convulsions were recorded in any of these events. In all cases, treatment in the hospital was gastric lavage and atropine, and the poisonings were resolved in < 24 hr.
PVM underwent cognitive testing in May 1998 and May 1999. During the first interview, he reported mnesic problems, such as remembering telephone numbers and the events of the previous day, but complained of no physical symptoms. He had completed secondary school and had been working in agriculture for 10 years. His estimated IQ was 105, and he obtained a score of 30 in the Mini Mental State Examination. Each outcome was evaluated in relation to his educational level, estimated IQ, sex, and age. Tests of single-word reading, writing skills, basic mental, and written arithmetic and semantic knowledge were completed correctly. Physical and neurological assessment did not show any alteration at the time of the neuropsychological testing. He did not receive pharmacological treatment.
During the second assessment in May 1999, he reported that he continued working in the greenhouse. No further poisoning events had been recorded during this time. The magnetic resonance image (MRI) taken a year after the last poisoning event did not reveal any evidence of brain injury. He reported no physical complaints.
In 1998, PVM’s performance was below expectation for estimated premorbid abilities in the domains of motor skills and short and long-term memory. Deficits at the level of learning new information were detected on several tasks, but he showed forgetting of information over a delay only in visuospatial tasks. His outcomes reflected slowness in the copying of a complex figure or the fulfillment of a complex attentional task ().
When comparing his 1999 performance with that of 1998, the speed of processing appeared to improve, although probably due to a practice effect. Yet, disturbances remained in the short- and long-term logical memory, as well as in visual memory, and in motor tasks such as alternation and coordination, which implies programming and motor regulation injury. His score for depression was in the normal range, whereas the Taylor Anxiety Scale score () showed a subtle increase, although still in normal range. During the assessment sessions, the patient was cooperative but very worried about the possibility of sequelae."
128,645950,45017,531589,"A 52-year-old male chemical worker was admitted to the hospital with a history of paroxysmal microscopic hematuria for about 2 years and nocturia with gross hematuria about five times per night for 2 months. He was a nonsmoker and denied taking any medication. He did not use hair dye or reside in an area with endemic blackfoot disease (arsenic intoxication). Social alcohol drinking was noted.
Microscopic hematuria was noted in the periodic health examinations for about 2 years, but the patient ignored it. Two months before admission, he developed nocturia about five times per night. Paroxysmal painless hematuria was also noted. Gross hematuria accompanied by lower abdominal distress occurred 2 weeks before admission. His body weight had decreased from 75 kg to 72 kg over the previous 3 months. He visited the hospital, and an intravenous urogram (IVU) showed a mass occupying half of the bladder capacity. Cystoscopy revealed a mass over the left dome area of the bladder. Cystoscopic biopsy specimens revealed a grade 3/3 invasive transitional cell carcinoma with marked necrosis. Radical cystectomy with ileal conduit combined with radiotherapy was performed because the bladder tissue showed lymphovascular permeation with lymph node metastasis. The worker is still on medical leave because of disease.
The manufacturing of MBOCA includes the reaction, neutralization, washing, purification, and packing processes. Briefly, o-chloroaniline is reacted with sulfuric acid and formaldehyde under the catalyst of stannous chloride for 3–4 hr. The MBOCA products are then neutralized with an alkali, sodium hydroxide, at a high temperature. After washing and purification, the solid MBOCA is cut into pellets. Although most of the processes are done in closed systems and are automatic, leakage of products from pipes and tanks has been reported. The work schedule in the factory where our patient worked has three 8-hr shifts, and three or four workers in each shift are assigned to each manufacturing line.
The patient was a farmer until he began working at this factory. He worked in the purification area of this MBOCA-producing company for 14 years (1987–2001), and he did not wear any personal protective equipment during work. He denied working for any chemical company other than his present company. He occasionally applied pesticides during agricultural work.
An area sampling program to monitor MBOCA levels in the work environment of this MBOCA manufacturing factory was initiated by the Taiwan Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (IOSH), Council of Labor Affairs (IOSH 2003a). The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA) Analytic Method 24 was adopted in this study (OSHA 1981). Briefly, an impinger filled with 0.1N HCl was used for sampling. The sampling rate was 1 L/min. The sampling time was > 6 hr or > 100 L air. The solution was then analyzed with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a 254 nm ultraviolet (UV) detector. The detection limit was 0.056 μg/mL. A quality assurance and quality control program was implemented during the sampling and analysis procedures. All quality tests were shown to be adequate (IOSH 2003a).
Two consecutive days’ air samples were collected in the MBOCA-manufacturing factory, in the areas where the reaction, neutralization, washing, purification, and cutting/packing processes took place. The concentration of MBOCA was highest in the purification area (0.23–0.41 mg/m3, n = 2), followed by the washing area (< 0.02–0.08 mg/m3, n = 7) and the neutralization area (< 0.05–0.06 mg/m3, n = 2) (IOSH 2003a). The concentrations of MBOCA were within OSHA permissible exposure level (0.22 mg/m3) except for the purification area, where levels exceeded permissible levels.
In addition to environmental monitoring, the Taiwan IOSH also collected workers’ urine to monitor MBOCA concentrations. The U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) analytic method 8302 (NIOSH 1994) and the method used by were adopted in this study. Briefly, sulfamic acid (10 g/L) was used as urine preservative, and urine was neutralized by sodium hydroxide (0.05 g/mL). After cleaning with the Extrelut NT3 column (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and evaporating with methanol, the concentrated urine was analyzed by HPLC with a 254 nm UV detector. The limit of detection was 9.54 μg/L.
Urine from 10 workers in this MBOCA-manufacturing company was analyzed. The total urine MBOCA concentrations ranged from 267.9 to 15701.1 μg/g creatinine, with a mean of 5,544 μg/g creatinine (IOSH 2003b). All the urine MBOCA concentrations far exceeded the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal-OSHA) reference value of 100 μg/L ()."
129,645950,227309,987736,"A 46-year-old male surgical pathologist presented to our clinic complaining of a 4-year history of increasing shortness of breath. He had been in good health until 20 years prior while in medical school, when he noted a pruritic, erythematous rash on the dorsal aspect of his hands whenever he wore latex gloves. He often applied steroid cream to the rash, but it usually did not resolve unless he refrained from using latex gloves. This rash, associated with latex glove use, persisted during his internal medicine residency. Approximately 14 years before presentation, at the beginning of his pathology residency, he noted that the rash involved his arms. He developed an episodic, nonproductive cough, wheezing, and occasional chest tightness, which occurred at work when he used powdered latex gloves. These symptoms were mild and did not interfere with his vigorous exercise program. He did not seek medical attention.
After completing his residency, the patient worked as a hospital-based surgical pathologist. Typical daily activities involved cutting tissue and frozen sections and preparing slides. He changed gloves several times each day. He did reasonably well until 4 years before presentation (1993), when his symptoms worsened. He then experienced cough and dyspnea within 30 min of starting work. These symptoms, which continued throughout the workday and improved once he left work, seemed especially severe on the first day of the workweek and worsened as the week progressed. The use of xylene and formaldehyde exacerbated his symptoms. He noted an intermittent rash on his upper extremities and torso, occasional flushing with exposure to latex, postnasal drip, progressive dyspnea on exertion, and dyspnea and coughing when he laughed. He noted heavy breathing if he “flipped” his gloves off, and he described an episode of “passing out” 1 year earlier when he “flipped” his gloves off and placed his hands over his mouth and nose. He was taken to a local emergency department, where he was diagnosed as having had a vasovagal episode. He was returned to work without intervention.
The patient’s wife and co-workers started commenting on his cough, noting that he “breathed heavily.” He became self-conscious about his cough and about constantly having to clear his throat. There was no seasonal variation to his symptoms. The patient attempted to reduce his exposure to powdered natural rubber latex (NRL) gloves, formaldehyde, and xylene. For example, he switched to non-powdered latex gloves, although his co-workers continued to use the powdered form. He replaced eyecups on the microscope once he realized that they contained latex. He instructed his staff to allow an hour for drying slides fixed with formaldehyde and xylene before sending them to him to be read. His symptoms persisted, however, prompting him to seek medical attention.
The patient subsequently consulted with an allergist, an otorhinolaryngologist, and a dermatologist. Skin biopsy of his rash revealed changes consistent with acute urticaria. Latex skin prick tests were positive to latex glove extracts. Skin prick tests were positive to dust, cat dander, and mold antigens, and a computerized tomography (CT) scan of the sinuses revealed nasal polyps in the maxillary sinus. He was diagnosed with chronic sinusitis, asthma, and allergic rhinitis. Treatment included antibiotics and a steroid taper. The patient was started on Serevent (GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC), Flovent (GlaxoSmithKline), and Proventil (Schering, Kenilworth, NJ) inhalers and returned to work with the recommendation that he use a surgical mask while at work. His symptoms continued to progress, and he presented to us 2 months later, by which time he was experiencing single-flight dyspnea.
The patient’s past medical history was remarkable for hypertension, nasal polyps, and near syncope. He denied any previous diagnosis of asthma, allergy, hives, or anaphylaxis. His family history was remarkable for asthma in a sister and a paternal uncle. He denied use of alcohol, cigarettes, or illegal drugs and denied allergies to medications or environmental substances. He gave a history of chest tightness when he ate fruit such as banana, avocado, and kiwi. His occupational history was remarkable for work in the medical field (). On physical examination, he was a well-nourished, well-developed white male in no acute distress whose vital signs were within normal limits. His examination was remarkable for a body mass index of 30, hyperemic conjunctivae, boggy nasal mucosa, an erythematous urticarial rash on his right shoulder, and diffuse expiratory wheezing.
Laboratory evaluation revealed a normal electrocardiogram. Chest X ray showed poor inspiration; CT of the chest showed mild bronchial wall thickening consistent with mild airways disease; pulmonary function tests (PFTs) were remarkable for mild obstruction with acute bronchodilator response (); and a radioallergoimmuno-absorbent assay (RAST) test for latex IgE antibody was negative. His peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) diary during an 11-day work period and a subsequent 6-day vacation period showed significant improvement (20% in the morning, 22% in the evening) while he was away from work () and progressive improvement during successive days of vacation ().
The provision of a latex-safe environment was explored with hospital administration and deemed not feasible at that time. A full-face dual-cartridge respirator was recommended and tried in consultation with a certified industrial hygienist. However, it interfered with the patient’s ability to communicate, and he was unable to tolerate wearing it for an 8-hr day. We felt that he was at risk for potentially fatal anaphylaxis, as well as irreversible and impending structural damage to his lungs, given his long history of exposure and disease severity. In order to eliminate exposure to NRL, the patient was removed from the work-place. He was advised to avoid contact with latex, carry injectable epinephrine, and wear a MedicAlert bracelet (MedicAlert Foundation International, Turlock, CA). Despite removal from the workplace shortly after presentation, the patient’s pulmonary status did not improve. He is maintained on steroids and immunosuppressive agents and has not been able to return to work as a surgical pathologist."
130,696539,531622,555974,"A 35 year old Caucasian female was found to be infected with HIV1 in 1989, when she tested after heterosexual exposure. She was put on zidovudine in 1995, when her CD4 lymphocyte count steadily declined. She took the drug intermittently until 1997, when she was still asymptomatic, with CD4 lymphocytes <100/μL and a high HIV1 viral load (>500 000 copies/mL). In July 1997, she started her first line HAART regimen including stavudine 30 mg twice a day (bid), lamivudine 150 mg bid and indinavir 800 mg 3 times a day. At that time her body weight was stable, her body shape was lean and preserved, with a body mass index (BMI) of 18.3. Adherence and response to treatment were optimal; she reached undetectable viremia (< 400 copies/mL) and a >200/μL CD4 lymphocyte gain by the 12th week of treatment. Since April 1998, the patient complained about remarkable breast size increase, fat accumulation at waist, and a fat pad grown over her lumbar spine. The pad was 7 × 10 × 3 cm in size by July, 1998. At that time indinavir was replaced with ritonavir/saquinavir 400/400 mg bid due to renal stones. Rapidly progressive, severe lipoatrophy at limbs, buttocks and face ensued in the following months, together with a further increase in size of her fat pads. HIV1 viremia remained constantly undetectable; metabolic parameters were normal throughout follow-up, with an isolated abnormal value of triglycerides (306 mg/dL) in August 1998. Adherence to treatment was full until April 2000, when the CD4 lymphocyte count was >500/μL. The patient was offered a simplified regimen, which she refused, preferring a sharp interruption of HAART. At that time, she did not allow us to take pictures. After interrupting HAART, HIV1 viremia rebounded to lower than baseline, remaining <100 000 copies/mL (mode, 25 000 copies/mL) thereafter. CD4 lymphocyte counts declined very slowly; the patient remained asymptomatic, regularly attending her follow-up visits. Her metabolic parameters, including triglycerides, remained within the normal range at all further checks. She decided to carry on without any treatment for over 4 years, until July 2004, when the CD4 lymphocyte count had dropped to 84/μL. Pads of fat accumulation at waist had reverted to nearly normal appearance; the lumbar pad was no longer appreciable; breasts were still enlarged, although to a lesser extent (Fig. ). At variance, lipoatrophy was still well evident; the patient admitted partial improvement at upper extremities, whereas she found no improvement at all for buttocks (Fig. ) and legs (Fig. and ). Her BMI had dropped to 17.3. The patient was offered a new HAART regimen including nevirapine 200 mg bid, tenofovir diproxil 300 mg once a day and lamivudine 150 mg bid; adherence was full until her last visit, on December 23th, 2004, with a CD4 lymphocyte count of 250/μL and a viral load of 1250 copies/mL.
Our observation provides pictorial evidence that severe combined lipodystrophy in our patient was only partially reversible, even under the ideal condition of a long lasting and safe interruption of HAART. Recent reports indicate that the loss of CD4 lymphocytes during treatment interruptions is frequently rapid in patients with a Nadir CD4 lymphocyte count <200/μL and a high rate of cell gain under treatment, irrespective of the level of CD4 lymphocyte count at the interruption of HAART [,]. In spite of that, our patient could safely carry her interruption on for over 4 years, remaining asymptomatic throughout the period, with >200 CD4 T-lymphocytes/μL until late in 2003. She did eat a light and balanced diet; she reported taking L-carnitine (5 grams/daily) since June, 2000, until June, 2001, whereas she denied taking any other drug or supplement possibly interfering with lipid metabolism thereafter. Under these extremely favourable circumstances, sites of lumbar and waist fat accumulation reverted to nearly normal appearance, whereas breasts showed partial improvement (Fig. ). Such a clear-cut reversal of fat accumulation has not been reported in controlled trials investigating the efficacy of therapy switches [-], probably because of persistent interference with lipid metabolism caused by the new antiretroviral drugs [-].
Severe lipoatrophy at buttocks and legs, instead, was unchanged both on patient's and on our judgment (Fig. and ). Although it is plausible that instrumental measurements at the affected sites might have detected partial improvements, our observation suggests that the loss of peripheral adipose tissue caused by HAART [-,] may not be fully reversible after treatment interruption, even in the long run."
131,696539,821646,964140,"A 38-year-old female presented with a one day history of acute epigastric pain. There was no nausea or vomiting. She had developed non-Insulin dependant diabetes 18 months previously. On examination she was overweight and there was epigastric tenderness, but no mass was palpable. All haematological and biochemical parameters were within normal limits.
Abdominal ultrasonography demonstrated a 5 × 3 cm partially cystic mass in distal pancreas with a possibility of a cystic neoplasm. A contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed a 2 cm mass in the body of pancreas (Figure ). Dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a 4 cm cystic lesion in the body of Pancreas suggestive of a mucinous cyst adenocarcinoma (Figure ). No liver or abdominal metastases were detected on either the ultrasound or CT examination.
The patient underwent staging laparoscopy which showed no metastases. Laparotomy was performed. An en-block distal pancreatectomy, including the pancreatic mass, and splenectomy was performed with full clearance of peri-pancreatic and coeliac nodes. The patient made an uneventful recovery.
On gross examination the pancreatic tumour was oval, 7.0 cm in diameter, and was surrounded by a fibrous pseudocapsule. Its cut surface showed solid and cystic spaces (Figure ). On microscopy, the solid portion of the tumour revealed sheets of uniform polygonal cells as well as dyscohesive papillae arranged around fine fibrovascular cores. The cyst wall was composed of dense acellular fibrous tissue within which the tumour cells were arranged as cords and trabeculae set within a mucinous background (Figure ).
No invasion of the tumour into surrounding normal tissue was present. The tumour cells were strongly positive for vimentin and alpha-1 antitrypsin and showed faint focal positivity with MNF116 and chromogranin."
132,701399,643126,630509,"In June 2002, a boy aged 4 years and three months, was referred to the outpatient clinic of oncology of the Erasmus Medical Center of Rotterdam. One year before, penis growth had started to accelerate rapidly and 2 months prior to admission, his height had started to increase tremendously, pubic hair had started to grow, his voice had started breaking, and sweat production had increased. Furthermore, he often had erections during the day, got interested in older girls, and started reading magazines that contained pictures of naked women.
At clinical examination, his length was 120 cm (more than 2.5 SD above average) and he weighed 24.6 kg (weight/height ratio +1 SD). His sexual development had reached Tanner stages P3, G3 [], with no underarm hair growth. Examination of his genitals showed a left testis of 2 ml and a right testis of 6 ml, firm and painless. Further clinical examination was negative, except for glue ears. X-rays of his hand showed that his skeletal age was 5 years ahead of his calendar age. His testosterone level (10.6 nmol/l) was raised to a pubertal level, as well as his DHEA-S level (1.30 μmol/l). Tumour markers carcino-embryonal antigen (CEA), alpha-fetoprotein, and beta human choriogonadotropin (β-HCG) were negative. Ultrasound of the testes showed a testicular tumour. Neither abdominal ultrasound nor abdominal CT or full bonescan (209MBq TC99M) showed signs of metastases.
Pseudo pubertas praecox based on a testicular tumour was diagnosed. After unilateral orchidectomy, pathological examination showed a Leydig Cell Tumour. One week after orchidectomy, hormone levels had normalized (testosterone < 0.10 nmol/l, DHEA-S < 0.20 μmol/l), he stopped having erections, and sweat production decreased, as did his sexual interest. His mother reported he had become more of a child again.
Because of anxiety, some behavioural problems, and delayed speech development, the boy was referred to our outpatient unit for child and adolescent psychiatry. At psychiatric examination, January 2003, we saw a boy who was anxious and withdrawn, had problems in social interaction, and a delayed speech development. Parents reported he had always been very quiet, however, since the beginning of 2002 he had started withdrawing himself more and more from social interactions, both at home and in school. To obtain standardized ratings of psychopathology, both parents, as well as the schoolteacher, were asked to fill out the Child Behaviour Checklist for ages 1 1/2–5 (CBCL 1 1/2–5) and the Caregiver-Teacher Report Form for ages 1 1/2–5 (C-TRF 1 1/2–5) []. The mother and the father scored the patient in the clinical range of the Withdrawn Behaviour, Anxious/Depressed Behaviour, and Somatic Complaint scales, but not on the Emotionally Reactive Behaviour, Sleep Problems, Attention Problems, and Aggressive Behaviour scales. The clinical cut-off corresponds with the 98th percentile score in a general population sample []. Although the schoolteacher described the boy as quiet and withdrawn, and mentioned delayed speech development, C-TRF syndrome scores were not in the clinical range. No symptoms of externalizing behaviour (aggression, hyperactive behaviour or attention problems) were reported by the parents or the teacher, nor seen during psychiatric assessment. Further psychological testing showed that the boy's intellectual functioning was below average (Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence – Revised []: Total IQ = 84; Verbal IQ = 82; Performance IQ = 92). DSM-IV [] chronic adjustment disorder with anxiety was diagnosed."
133,701399,490877,509532,"A 50-year-old non-diabetic, non-hypertensive lady presented with 2 months history of progressive blackish discoloration of the toes bilaterally. Examination revealed gangrene of the Right great toe, 2nd toe & early gangrenous changes in the 3rd toe. All the peripheral arteries were well felt, there was no radiofemoral delay. There was no cardiac murmur or a carotid bruit.
She was found to have madarosis & hypopigmented, hypoaesthetic macular lesions on the upper limb & thighs. Bilateral ulnar & popliteal nerves were thickened. A skin biopsy of the lesions revealed borderline tuberculoid leprosy. Slit skin smears revealed a bacteriological index of 1+. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 105, lipid profile & fasting sugars were normal & anti neutrophil cytoplsmic antibody (ANCA) negative.
Anti Cardiolipin antibody (ACLA) was positive at presentation (IgG-8; IgM-28.5; ELISA Genesis Diagnostics, Cambridgeshire, UK) & also on another occasion 6 weeks later (IgG-7.5; IgM-29; ELISA Genesis Diagnostics, Cambridgeshire, UK). Thus, ACLAs were of the IgM type on both occasions. Lupus Anticoagulant (PT, aPPT, Mixing studies, DRVVT) & β2 GPI antibody were negative (IgG-1; IgM-2.5; ELISA Genesis Diagnostics, Cambridgeshire, UK). DOPPLER of the lower limb arteries did not reveal any abnormality. Tests for other hypercoagulable states (protein C, protein S, Antithrombin III, homocystein, factor V Leiden) were normal.
The patient improved with the multi drug anti leprotics & anticoagulants. By 6 weeks, there was no progression of/ fresh gangrene & the pre gangrenous changes in the 3rd toe had resolved."
134,714903,214970,5715,"We describe the case of a 54 year old, non-smoker, Caucasian woman, a computer programmer, who was admitted to the General Hospital in June 2003, following an episode of overdose with Citalopram and alcohol. At the time of her admission, she gave a history of depression and suicidal ideation for six months. She was not known to the local psychiatric service.
The patient was discovered by her twin sister soon after the overdose. Initially, she had disclosed to the medical doctor admitting her that she had taken approximately 14 tablets of 20 mgs of Citalopram along with 2 bottles of red wine. However, later on she informed us that she might have taken up to 30 tablets of 20 mgs Citalopram. The actual amount ingested remains unclear.
Soon after her admission, she complained of painful left eye with blurred vision, and was seen by the Ophthalmologist, who found that our patient had an intra-ocular pressure of 23 mmHg in the right eye and 60 mmHg of mercury in the left eye (Normal IOP-10–20 mm Hg), with left corneal edema, and fixed dilated pupils. She was not hypermetripic and had averaged sized eyes. She was noted to have shallow anterior chambers (central and peripheral depth not available) in both of her eyes. A diagnosis of left angle-closure glaucoma was made and medications were commenced to reduce the elevated IOP. Further investigations including routine blood investigations revealed no abnormalities. Her pulse rate and blood pressure were normal. She had a blood alcohol level of 85 mgs/dl (Less than 10 indicates safe levels and 50–100 indicates toxic levels). Her blood test did not reveal any detectable levels paracetamol or salicylates.
With regard to her background history, there was previous episode of overdose with paracetamol tablets in 1978. There was no history suggestive of physical illness, and specifically, no history of previous eye problems. There was no family history of eye related conditions. In December 2002, her general practitioner had diagnosed her to be suffering from depression with harmful misuse of alcohol, and commenced her on Citalopram 20 mgs daily. Later, she informed us that she had not taken any of this prescribed medication prior to her overdose and had only been taking Estrogens, given for hormone replacement (Prempak-C).
Approximately 48 hours after the overdose, on examination of her eyes, she was found to have left subhyaloid and retinal hemorrhages. After 72 hours, the visual acuity in the right eye was 6/9 and hand movements in the left eye. The intraocular pressures were reasonably controlled and she had bilateral Yag laser iridotomies. Subsequently, she was discharged to the local psychiatric unit as she continued to express suicidal thoughts and was low in mood. Apart from receiving treatment for her eye problems at the general hospital, she was commenced on a reducing regime of chlordiazepoxide for her alcohol dependence. On discharge from the general hospital, she was advised to continue on Timolol, pilocarpine and dexamethasone eye drops for further 14 days.
She remained free of anti-depressants and her mood improved gradually in the absence of alcohol. After 14 days, her visual acuity was noted to be 6/18 in the left eye, which improved to 6/12 on pinhole. Her ocular condition was noted to be stable. Her ocular pressures were 14 mmHg in the right eye and 15 mmHg in the left eye, but still had retinal hemorrhages on the left eye, with a clearing vitreous hemorrhage.
She was followed-up by the Ophthalmologists and discharged from the psychiatric hospital after 4 weeks with further community support.
In August 2004, her right eye visual acuity was noted to be 6/9, which improved to 6/6 with pinhole and her left eye vision was 6/24, which did not improve with pinhole. She had a left afferent papillary deficit. The pre-retinal and retinal hemorrhages had cleared, but she still had some residual vitreous hemorrhage. Her right eye Intra-ocular pressure was 18 mmHg and left was 19 mmHg without any treatment. She is reviewed by the local eye clinic every six months."
135,714903,319700,191428,"A 72-year-old woman with chronic atrial fibrillation, temporal arteritis, and avascular necrosis of the right hip requiring hemiarthroplasty that was complicated by deep venous thrombosis in the past, now presents with new onset left upper extremity clumsiness. A head computed tomography (CT) scan and subsequent magnetic resonance imaging study revealed a hemorrhage into the right parietal and occipital regions of the brain. In view of these findings, warfarin therapy was discontinued and as part of the workup a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed and revealed a 4 × 6 mm mass on the aortic valve and a patent foramen ovale (PFO) with bidirectional shunting (right to left after the intravenous injection of agitated saline), mild bi-atrial enlargement, mildly dilated but normally functioning right ventricle, normal left ventricular systolic function and no significant valvular regurgitation. The patient was afebrile and blood cultures were negative. The patient was referred to our institution for surgical evaluation given the TEE findings and the patient clinical presentation. Surgical resection of the aortic valve mass and closure of the PFO were recommended.
Upon examination of the aortic valve, a filamentous mass was identified on the leading edge of the noncoronary cusp midway between the ranula and the commisure. The mass was excised with sharp dissection. A second 2 × 3 mm mass was also observed on the underside of the leaflet and was excised in a similar fashion. Lesions were also observed at the commisure and on the left coronary cusp and were also excised. Pathologic examination subsequently revealed that these lesions were small fragments of myxoid tissue with hyalinization. A modified Maze procedure was also performed at the time of surgery and it required mobilization of the pulmonary veins bilaterally with application of radiofrequency lesions just proximal to the entrance of the left and right pulmonary veins. Another radiofrequency lesion was placed at the base of the left atrial appendage and this was then excised and then over sewn. Finally, the right atrium was then opened in a longitudinal fashion, the PFO was identified at the cephalad portion of the fossa ovalis and was then closed in a running fashion.
The patient was weaned from bypass without incident and a TEE performed in the operating room revealed no residual masses on the aortic valve or right to left shunt. However, a mild degree of tricuspid regurgitation was now identified for the first time. Both right ventricular size and systolic function remained normal. The patient was taken to the intensive care unit in stable condition and the immediate post-operative course was unremarkable. There was no need for either vasopressor or ionotropic support and the patient was extubated on the first post-operative day and subsequently transferred to a step down unit.
The patient did well until the night of the second post-operative day when she developed oliguria that progressively worsened followed by tachycardia and hypotension. At this time, a pronounced jugular venous distention was noted and a bedside transthoracic echo was immediately obtained to rule out the presence of pericardial tamponade. No pericardial effusion was noted; however, severe tricuspid regurgitation was now noted with dilatation and dysfunction of the right ventricle. In view of these findings, a spiral chest CT was requested but there was no evidence of pulmonary embolus; however, both superior as well as inferior vena cavae were dilated. The pericardium thickness was reported as normal. Because the clinical deterioration persisted, the patient was taken back to the operating room for mediastinal exploration; only a small amount of pericardial fluid was removed. Although the pericardial sac appeared to be under tension, no clot was found after extensive exploration.
Despite a trial of medical management, the patient's cardiac index remained low and all facial and neck veins became progressively and markedly engorged. A repeated TEE demonstrated marked dilatation of the right-sided chambers with severe reduction in right ventricular systolic function (Figure ) and severe tricuspid regurgitation as a result of an incomplete coaptation of the tricuspid valve leaflets (Figure ). During this TEE, normal left ventricular contractility was noted with no regional wall motion abnormalities, with the exception of a paradoxical septal wall motion as expected post recent surgery, and normal left ventricular systolic function. In addition, pulsed interrogation of all four pulmonary veins showed normal velocities in order to rule out post-surgical Maze procedure pulmonary vein stenosis. No visible alteration in either the main or secondary pulmonary arteries was seen by TEE or CT. Although a clear unifying mechanism that would encompass the hemodynamic deterioration as well as the disproportionate symptoms of dyspnea with the rapidly progressive dilatation of all superficial neck and facial veins could not be given, it was clearly evident that the incomplete coaptation of the tricuspid valve leaflets, as seen on TEE, would certainly continue to further deteriorate the current clinical condition. Therefore, the patient was taken to the operating room again and upon opening the right atrium, the dilatation of the tricuspid valve annulus was confirmed resulting in failure of coaptation of the otherwise normal appearing tricuspid leaflets. Tricuspid annuloplasty with a 34 mm Cosgrove band was performed with marked improvement in cardiac output not requiring further inotropic support. A postoperative TEE revealed no evidence of residual tricuspid regurgitation and the chest was closed. The remainder of the patient's post-operative course was uncomplicated. Unfractionated intravenous heparin was started once the surgeon felt it was safe to maintain a therapeutic activated partial thromboplastin time. The pronounced engorgement of her neck and face veins resolved and she remained hemodynamically stable. After the 5th postoperative day, the patient was transferred to a rehabilitation facility. At one-month follow-up, the patient has remained in atrial fibrillation, but is otherwise doing well."
136,723096,322687,856280,"A 23-year-old man was referred by his general dental practitioner. One year ago the dentist diagnosed a cyst with a ectopic lower right canine tooth by an x-ray. Beside an uneventful medical history the patient presented no conspicuous intraoral clinical findings except the absence of the tooth 43. Radiologically, he showed a 3 cm unicystic radiolucent image with a comparatively clear demarcation. The tooth 43 was located on the floor of this process. No resorption of the root apices was observed (Fig. ).
Under general anesthesia the lesion was enucleated and afterwards filled with pelvic spongiosa. Separating the lesion from mandibular bone caused no problems. The postoperative course was uneventful.
After the operation, the specimen was fixed in 4 per cent formal saline and prepared for histological examination. Some sections were stained with haematoxylin-eosin.
Histologically, the tumor is solid and there is a cyst formation (Fig. ). The epithelium is in the form of whorled masses of spindle cells as well as sheets and plexiform strands. Rings of columnar cells give rise to duct-like appearance (Fig. ). Calcification is sometimes seen and may be extensive (Fig. ).
Half a year after surgery a clinical and radiographic follow-up examination was performed. There was no evidence of recurrence and no apical resorption of the adjacent teeth could be observed (Fig. ).
With respect to the age of the patient and the localization of the AOT in the lower jaw, the reported case is a rare example of this tumor entity. Beyond it our case supports the above mentioned general description of AOTs."
137,723096,265625,700491,"A 24 year old male, professional sportsman presented to the accident and emergency department of a district general hospital with ankle pain and swelling following an innocuous hyper-plantar flexion injury to his right ankle by kicking a ball in mid-air, while playing soccer.
The ankle was noted to be swollen with discolouration (Fig. ). There was localised tenderness at the lateral malleolus. X-Rays of the ankle did not reveal any bony injury. A presumed diagnosis of ligament damage was made and the patient reassured and discharged.
He re-presented to the accident and emergency department 5 days later, having developed an area of skin ulceration 1 cm proximal to the lateral malleolus. Ultrasound Doppler studies were performed, which demonstrated the presence of an anterior tibial artery aneurysm, confirmed by transfemoral arteriogram (Fig ).
This aneurysm was injected with Thrombin 5000 iu and collagen 200 mg, after written, informed, consent was obtained from the patient, in order to attempt to manage the aneurysm by a percutaneous route using a method well established for the treatment of other pseudoaneurysms. This had a good radiological result with thrombosis of the aneurysm on both duplex and arteriogram.
Progress was monitored via duplex imaging and on day 3 the aneurysm was noted to be partially patent. The patient elected to proceed to surgery with ligation of the anterior tibial artery proximal to the aneurysm. He recovered uneventfully, and at one year follow up has good ankle function allowing him to return to playing recreational soccer, however did not return to professional sport."
138,761145,231793,339,"The propositus in this family (IV6) is a 45 year old Caucasian female who was diagnosed with LPD at the age of 24. Childhood was unremarkable for medical conditions, starting at the age of 17 she had recurrent episodes of prolonged abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting. During multiple admissions to the emergency department, abdominal X-rays showed repeatedly intestinal obstruction. No further investigation regarding the cause for this abdominal pain was undertaken until the age of 24. During an abdominal gynecological laparatomy -conducted because of recurrent abdominal pain and dysmenorrhoe- multiple polypoid pedunculated lesions on the large bowels were seen (see Figure ), biopsy was not carried out because the lesions were well vascularized. On surgical abdominal exploratory laparotomy about 50 fibromatous tumors were found and removed from the serosal surfaces, small and large bowels, omentum and from the uterus. Histopathological analysis of these tumors revealed benign spindle cell tumors, classified as leiomyoma. Electron microscopy showed peculiar nodules consisting of mature fibroblasts, abundant collagen with a few admixed myofibroblasts. At the age of 29 the patient had another episode of severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting and abdominal distension, partial small bowel obstruction was seen again on abdominal X-rays. The patient had no further episode of abdominal discomfort until now and presented to us for further evaluation with abdominal bloating and discomfort. Other recorded medical conditions include Raynaud's disease (diagnosed at the age of 19), Prurigo nodularis with lichenification of the skin (onset of symptoms in adolescence, see Figure ) and recently diagnosed postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (diagnosed at age 44).
Her clinical exam of the abdomen revealed nothing except abdominal distension, no masses or tenderness were noted. Inspection of the skin revealed dry lichenificated skin on all extremities with prominent itching nodules (see Figure ). Laboratory findings were normal at admission.
The mother of the patient (III10) is now at age 82 and was diagnosed with Leiomyomatosis peritonealis disseminata at the age of 25. She also had recurrent episodes of severe prolonged abdominal pain and underwent exploratory laparotomy due to a ruptured appendix. Incidentally a large number of tumorous lesions was found, which were later on classified as leiomyomas. Interestingly this patient also was diagnosed with Raynaud's disease and has Prurigo nodularis-like skin lesions. The sister of this patient (III13) died at age 16 of peritonitis and sepsis. On post mortem examination intestinal obstruction due to multiple tumorous lesions was found as origin of peritonitis. Another brother (III17) died of peritonitis and gangrene of the bowels at the age of 20, resulting from intestinal obstruction of multiple pedunculated tumors (as reported by operating surgeon, 1939).
The grandfather (II3) of the propositus never was diagnosed LPD but has a past medical history of abdominal problems, including intestinal obstructions. Unfortunately no further information was available.
Three more members of the family are affected by LPD and furthermore have been diagnosed with Raynaud's disease and show Prurigo nodularis with skin lichenification. All three patients (IV2, IV3, IV4) had abdominal problems (e.g. prolonged severe abdominal pain) in their late teenage years and underwent explorative laparotomy, which showed more than 50 tumors in every case. The receptor status for progesteron- and estrogen-receptors was negative in these three patients. Patient V1 is the 10 year old son of patient IV2 and already had a complete intestinal obstruction, on explorative laparotomy more than 100 pedunculated tumors have been found in the abdominal cavity.
Patients IV5, IV7 and V2 reportedly have or had abdominal problems, but no confirmed diagnosis was available. No information on medical conditions, post mortem examinations or confirmed diagnoses was available for patients I1 and I2, grand-grandparents of the propositus (IV6)."
139,761145,975688,641306,"A 30-year-old unmarried, male, clerk presented with the persistent fear that his penis was shrinking gradually for last 12 years. He stated that due to the shrinkage he remained weak, anxious and sleepless. He continuously brooded over it. He got panicky whenever he saw his penis, as he felt that it is shrinking back, and remained perturbed for days together after that. Due to this he consciously avoided to see or contact his penis, even in bathroom. He explained that it was due to his nocturnal emissions and a couple of masturbatory acts in middle adolescence. He was extremely religious and attended religious institutions (like that of Satsang and Brahmakumaris). He considered penis as sacred and its gradual shrinkage as an omen of his ultimate destruction and death. He believed that this was due to sinful (anti-religious) incidences of nocturnal emission and masturbatory acts. He had decided not to marry in order to avoid any possible retraction. He remained preoccupied with these thoughts, avoided company, and interaction with females. He requested for medicines that would stop further retraction.
He had been given anxiolytics, sedatives, antidepressants and anti-psychotics at various point of time by many practitioners and had been counselled. His symptoms persisted with intermittent exacerbations without much relief.
Unlike obsession his thoughts were never resisted. His belief had influenced his behaviour and way of life, was shakeable, and appeared more like overvalued ideas. His mood state was predominantly anxious with occasional panic attacks associated with somatic equivalents. He did not have any other major psychiatric syndrome.
A 41-year-old unmarried, unemployed male from a business family, presented with the complaints of gradual retraction of penis and scrotum into the abdomen. He had frequent panic attacks feeling that the end had come. The symptoms had persisted more than 15 years with a waxing and waning course. During exacerbations he spent most of his time measuring the penis by a scale and pulling it in order to bring it out of abdomen. He tied a string around it and attached it to a hook above to prevent its shrinkage during night. There was a history of excessive sexual indulgence in the early twenties with prostitutes and he had suffered repeatedly from sexually transmitted diseases characterised by discharges (probably gonorrhoea) and ulcers (probably syphilis). He was adequately treated for that. He did not have remorse or guilt over those happenings. He continued visiting prostitutes occasionally and described no inadequacy in sex. He engaged his partner in fellatio in order to bring the penis out. He refused marriage, as he feared that his life was at stake due to this shrinkage as he had had many experiences of nearing death due to that. He did not have regular work and was mostly dependent on the family.
He had been treated with anxiolytics and occasionally with antipsychotic medications with minimal benefit. He had received psycho-education. He frequently engaged in doctor shopping and tried to see doctors before the appointment day expressing concern over his symptoms. He often used medicines from other fields of medicine (homeopathy, Ayurveda, unani) to prevent the retraction."
140,767335,217164,948086,"The patient was a 42-year-old man presenting acute myocardial infarction (STEMI). The year before, he had developed mesenteric ischemia due to mesenteric vein thrombosis and anticoagulant anti-phospholipid antibodies were evidenced. He was treated by sigmoïdectomy. No treatment by vitamin K antagonist was initiated following the former episode of mesenteric vein thrombosis.
Nine patients with STEMI and no past history of APS constituted a reference group. In this control subset, the absence of circulating APL (<10 GPL/ml) was verified on one single occasion.
All patients received the same treatment namely, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA), stent implantation, anti-platelet and anti-thrombin drugs (clopidogrel, aspirin, abciximab and low molecular weight or unfractionned heparin). Fifty healthy volunteers (HV) were simultaneously investigated. Investigations were approved by the local Ethic Committee."
141,767335,758777,232961,"A 72 year-old Japanese woman underwent abdominal ultrasonography (US) as part of a routine physical checkup in April 2001. This procedure incidentally detected marked dilatation of the main pancreatic duct (MPD) in the distal region of the pancreas. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed MPD dilatation and a multi-lobular cystic lesion. ERCP confirmed these findings, and no extraluminal leakage of the contrast medium was observed (Figure ). Cytology on pancreatic fluid indicated non-neoplastic epithelia. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) identified 8 mm papillary projections in the cystic lesion, which was a key indication for surgery. A routine gastroscopy performed simultaneously with EUS showed no significant findings.
Following the ERCP, the patient complained of abdominal pain and showed hyperamylasemia and leukocytosis. Distinct swelling of the pancreas and thickening of the gastric wall were subsequently observed by abdominal CT (Figure ), which indicated a mild post-ERCP pancreatitis. Gastroscopy performed for the assessment of gastric wall thickness revealed a small ulceration in the body of the stomach (Figure ), which was accompanied by a mucinous discharge suggesting the presence of a fistula opening into the MPD. These findings, along with abdominal angiography data indicating encasement of the splenic artery suggested a malignant invasion into the stomach by the primary lesion. All other laboratory data, including tumor marker expression (e.g., CEA and CA19-9), were within normal limits.
A laparotomy was performed 1 month after the ERCP. Firm fibrous tissue between the pancreas and the mesenterium of the transverse colon suggested the pancreatic neoplasm was of an invasive nature. An en bloc resection of the distal pancreas, spleen, stomach and part of the transverse colon was performed. Postoperative histopathology showed the distal pancreas had an IPMN whose lining epithelia showed only ""borderline-malignancy"" and no apparent invasion of adjacent tissues or organs. Light microscopy examination revealed inflammatory cellular infiltration consisting mainly of neutrophils around a pancreatogastric fistula which had no neoplastic epithelia (Figure ). The patient was discharged after an uneventful postoperative recovery and showed no signs of recurrence 3 years after surgery."
142,772533,719705,666580,"In July 2003, a 53-year-old man was admitted to the Timone hospital in Marseilles, France, presenting with clinical signs of acute endocarditis. He had a fever of 39°C that lasted for two weeks, anorexia, a weight loss of 7 kg since December 2002, a stroke with intracranial haemorrhage, and femoral arterial emboli. He had had an aortic replacement by a bioprosthesis in March 2002 for aortic insufficiency. In February 2003, the patient was hospitalized for undulating fever (38.5°C) that had lasted for the previous 3 months. The transeosophageal echocardiography showed neither valvular dysfunction nor vegetation. Six blood cultures were negative. The patient was treated with amoxicillin (1 g twice a day orally) for 8 days. The fever decreased but persisted at a level of 37.8°C. In July 2003, upon his admission, the echocardiography (multiplane transesophageal echocardiography) showed a vegetation on the aortic bioprothesis valve measuring 30 mm at its maximum, and a grade IV valvular regurgitation. The white blood cell count was of 14.36 × 109/L (92.7% polymorphonuclears, 5.0% lymphocytes, 2.3% monocytes), the haemoglobin level was of 90 g/L, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was of 50 mm/h (first hour), the C reactive protein level was of 208 mg/l. No rheumatoid factor was detected. All three aerobic blood cultures, as well as the removed femoral arterial thrombus yielded Pseudomonas luteola (P. luteola) within 48 h of culture. The microorganism was identified using both the API 20 E (Biomerieux,Marcy l'Etoile, France) and API 20 NE galeries (Biomerieux). The identification was confirmed by sequencing its 16S rDNA using the fD1 (AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG) and rP2 (ACGGCTACCTTGTTACGACTT) primers as previously described [,-]. The nucleotide sequence (GenBank accession number ) was compared with sequences available in GenBank using the BLAST version 2.2.9 software (National Center for Biotechnology Information) and showed 99.7% similarity with the 16S rDNA sequence of P. luteola (GenBank accession number ). The patient's isolate was susceptible to ampicillin, ureidopenicillin, third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and aminoglycosides. The patient was treated intravenously with ticarcillin + clavulanic acid (3 g five times per day) for 60 days, and gentamicin (210 mg once a day) for 15 days. The high dose of ticarcillin + clavulanic acid was justified by the cerebral involvement. In the course of antibiotic therapy, the fever resumed and the patient's condition improved. However, worsening aortic insufficiency led to the replacement of the aortic bioprothetic valve 76 days following admission. Macroscopic examination of the removed valve showed extensive aortic vegetation. Microscopic examination showed features typical of infectious endocarditis []. The bacterial culture of the valve was negative. The 16S rDNA PCR performed on valvular tissue was negative. Following cardiac surgery under extracorporeal circulation, the patient developed haemodynamic instability and renal insufficiency that required a prolonged hospitalization. The patient was released from hospital in February 2004, 7 months following admission.
Reported human P. luteola infections are rare. These have included a septicemia in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus under corticosteroid therapy who developed haemorrhagic pancreatitis complicated by a pancreatic abscess []; one case of bacteremia in a previously healthy patient with granulomatous hepatitis []; a bacteremia in a patient with peritonitis []; and non-bacteremic cases of peritonitis associated with gangrenous appendititis [] and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis []. Bacteremia has also been reported in patients with indwelling vascular catheters [-]. Other clinical isolates have been recovered from the bone of a patient with a femur abscess []; from a patient with a subphrenic abscess []; from the cerebrospinal fluid and wounds of neurosurgical patients with dural grafts or bone flaps []; from an HIV-infected patient with invasive cutaneous infection []; and from a patient with facial cellulitis []. To the best of our knowledge, only two cases of endocarditis caused by P. luteola have been reported in patients with prosthetic cardiac valves [,]. These patients had developed fever and blood cultures grew P. luteola 15 days [] and 45 days [], respectively, after cardiac surgery. In addition, one case of P. luteola septicemia has been described in a 5-month-old infant after open heart surgery for congenital cardiac disease []. Septicemia was diagnosed 8 days after surgery but no endocarditis was found. In the present case, as the patient did not undergo any invasive procedure between the 2002 valvular replacement and the onset of fever, we believe that he was infected during the initial cardiac surgery."
143,772533,776765,761304,"A 46-year-old female with symptoms of hoarseness and Horner's syndrome presented with a left cervical mass that was diagnosed to be undifferentiated carcinoma based on the findings of aspiration cytology (Figure ). The patient's chest computed tomography (CT) findings showed a mass measuring 5.0 cm in size spreading from the left upper mediastinum to the left supraclavicular area, which pressed against both the trachea and esophagus and it seemed to involve the left common carotid artery (Figure ). Based on these findings, and cytology findings a clinical diagnosis of stage IIIB (T4N3M0) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) originating from the apex of the left lung involving both the mediastinum and the supraclavicular lymph nodes was made []. The patient received concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (cisplatin 80 mg/m2 for days 8 and 36 + UFT 400 mg/m2, both on days 1–14 and on days 29–42 plus radiotherapy, 2 Gy/day on days 1–20 for a total of 40 Gy) []. After this treatment regimen, the tumor size decreased by 35.0%. Thereafter, the patient underwent a surgical resection though a median sternotomy with a combined resection of the left clavicle. During the operation, an encapsulated tumor was detected in the mediastinum. Although the tumor was easily ablated from the left common carotid artery, it involved both the left vagus and the sympathetic nerves. As a result, both nerves had to be sacrificed in order to achieve a complete resection of the tumor. Grossly, the tumor was in continuity of the vagus nerve was whitish in color and oval shaped measuring 5 × 3 cm in diameter (Figure ). Both cytological and histological examinations revealed 1) Continuity between the vagus nerve and tumor was seen, while the no continuity between the tumor and the sympathetic nerve was found. 2) The findings of aspiration cytology of the tumor diagnosing it to be undifferentiated carcinoma before the treatment included an atypical spindle cell. (Figure ). ) The predominantly tumor consisted of necrotic tissue and a few viable atypical spindle cells (Figure ) which were positive for S-100 protein (Figure ). As a result, the tumor was considered to arise from the left vagus nerve while invading the left sympathetic ganglion, and was therefore diagnosed it to be a malignant schwannoma. At present, the patient has survived for about 2 years since operation without any recurrence."
144,775699,99533,892579,"A 46-years-old woman presented with history of flank pain, abdominal lump and intermittent hematuria of 6 months duration. She was diagnosed as renal cell carcinoma (RCC) elsewhere and referred. The investigations at our hospital revealed normal hematological and biochemical parameters. The urine microscopy showed deformed RBC. The computerized tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen showed a large irregular well defined heterogeneous lesion occupying the left hypochondrium, lumbar and supra umbilical regions, measuring approximately 16 × 13.6 × 12.1 cm, and showed presence of predominant cystic portions with no obvious calcifications (figure &). The mass was contiguously involving the upper half of the kidney. Fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of the mass was suggestive of sarcomatoid renal cell carcinoma. The metastatic work-up including bone scan, and CT scan of the thorax were essentially normal. With a provisional diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma surgery was planned. Intra operatively a huge mass was observed in the retroperitoneal region arising from the left kidney and attempts to separate the mass from the kidney were unsuccessful. Hence, left nephrectomy with adrenalectomy was performed with complete excision of the tumor mass. Histopathology showed large encapsulated mass 16 × 17 × 12 cm attached to kidney on its posterior aspect. The tumor showed a predominantly spindle cell pattern consisting of cellular fascicles showing mild atypia, with a diffuse sprinkling of lymphocytes and plasma cells and a few lymphoid aggregates. Only an occasional mitosis was identified in these areas. Hypocellular areas with sparse cells and a collagenous stroma were also present. One area of the tumor showed features of malignant transformation, with sheets of bi and multinucleated and multilobed cells in a background of atypical spindle cells with interspersed inflammatory cells (figure ). Mitoses in this area were 3–4/high power field and focal necrosis was present. Immunohistochemisty for desmin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), cytokeratin (CK), CD68, HMB45 and ALK were performed. Desmin showed diffuse positivity, while SMA, EMA and CD68 showed focal positivity. CK, HMB45 and ALK were negative. A diagnosis of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor with malignant transformation was made."
145,775699,796649,442206,"A 25-year-old nurse, who had childhood chickenpox, was diagnosed with varicella without mention of complication [International Classification of Diseases, Revision 9 (ICD-9) code 052.9; ] by a dermatologic physician in a teaching general hospital after she cared for a 62-year-old male paraparesis patient who developed herpes zoster during hospitalization. She graduated from nursing school in July 2001, passed the licensing board, and then started to work in the neurologic surgery ward of a general teaching hospital in Taipei, Taiwan.
Toward the end of June, we conducted a study of occupational VZV hazards to health care workers in this hospital. The nurse was one of the volunteers who carried an air sampler for several hours in rotation with her colleagues on 9 July 2002. Saliva was collected simultaneously. Nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) VZV DNA results were negative both in the personal air samples and in saliva.
On 13 July 2002, a 62-year-old man was sent to the emergency room due to paraparesis after he received Chinese traditional chiropractic treatment from a nonprofessional. He was diagnosed with spondylitis with a T8 compression fracture and T9 myelopathy, suspected tuberculosis (TB) of the spine, and paraparesis and was transferred to a neurologic (internal medicine) ward in the evening. The next day he underwent surgery for total laminectomy (from T8 to T9) and hook system (from T6 to T11), and was sent to the surgical intensive care unit (SICU) for 5 days. On 18 July 2002, the patient was transferred to the neurologic surgery ward where the nurse worked.
Because the patient was suspected of having TB of the spine, he underwent pleural and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) biopsy on 1 August. According to the nurse’s observation, the patient was worried, anxious, and under a great deal of stress regarding his health because his income was the primary financial resource of his family. On 3 August, multiple pruritic rash and vesicles were found over the patient’s abdomen and lower back flank area. Herpes zoster was confirmed by a dermatologic physician.
During the patient’s hospitalization in the neurologic surgery ward, the nurse attended the patient for several days (on 19–22 July, 29 July, 31 July–1 August, and 4–5 August 2002) before she resigned from the job on 12 August. Her regular nursing care tasks included measuring body temperature, blood pressure, and pulse; administering medicine; asking how the patient was feeling; and helping the patient to change his bed rest position.
At the age of 5 years, the nurse had been infected with chickenpox by her kindergarten-age sister, who herself was previously infected by her kindergarten classmates. At that time, the nurse, her sister, and her brother had multiple chickenpox vesicles on their faces simultaneously. Because of her previous chickenpox history, it was supposed that the nurse was immune to the VZV; while caring for the patient, she did not wear gloves, a mask, or an isolation gown before the herpes zoster was confirmed.
Because she had passed the admission examination for graduate study in a medical school, the nurse planned to resign her job to become a full-time student by 15 August. Before she resigned, she took a short vacation to her hometown in Ping-Tung County, in the south of Taiwan, on 6 August. However, on 8 August, she developed a high fever (39.5°C, 103.1°F), malaise, and headache. She went to a private clinic and was diagnosed with influenza by a physician in her hometown. The next day, in addition to the prodromal symptoms, pruritic rash started to appear on her face, neck, and trunk. She came back to the teaching general hospital in Taipei on 9 August and was diagnosed with varicella without mention of complication (ICD-9 code 052.9) by another dermatologic physician (not the herpes zoster patient’s dermatologic physician). The nurse received treatment with Allegra (fexofenadine, 60 mg twice per day; Hoechst, Kansas City, MO, USA), chlorpheniramine (4 mg three time per day; Mine Ta Chemistry Pharmacy Co., Ltd., Tai Chung, Taiwan), and Scanol (acetominophen, 500 mg three times per day; Scanpharm, Birkerød, Denmark) for 14 days. Because her clinical symptoms were very clear, no laboratory confirmation testing was performed at that time. However, to confirm this second varicella episode before reporting this case, we invited the nurse to take serologic tests for varicella antibody on 4 April 2005. The results indicated that VZV-specific IgM was negative [< 1:20; Merifluor VZV IgM indirect fluorescent antibody, (IFA); Meridian Bioscience Inc., Cincinnati, OH, USA], but the VZV IgG was positive (1:80 on the basis of > 1:10, Merifluor VZV IgG IFA), with high sensitivity (93.9% for IgM and 100% for IgG) and high specificity (100% for both antibodies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Negative specific serum IgM and positive specific serum IgG indicated a past VZV infection. Because varicella and herpes zoster both resulted from the same antigen, the VZV IgG-positive reaction was excluded from the herpes zoster. It was also excluded because the nurse did not get herpes zoster from the second episode of varicella on 9 August 2002 to 4 April 2005. The nurse is now convalescing."
146,776038,436659,382328,"A 34-year old multigravida was found to have right adnexal mass on her routine gynecologic examination. Her previous medical history was uneventfull and Pap smear was normal. Transvaginal ultrasonography identified a cystic mass adjacent to the right ovary. Serum CA 125 was 5.1 U/ml (reference range: < 35 U/ml). At laparoscopy a dilated fallopian tube with bluish discoloration was found. The contralateral fallopian tube, ovaries and uterus were unremarkable. Exploration of the abdomino-pelvic cavity revealed smooth and shiny peritoneal surphace. Obtained peritoneal and pelvic washing were negative. Fine needle aspiration of dilated part of the fallopian tube revealed a 4 ml of bloody content. Cytological findings were consistent with hematosalpinx. Right salpingectomy was performed without using endoscopic bag. The patient was followed up by means of ultrasonography and serum CA 125 for 4.6 years. During this period she had no evidence of the disease.
Grossly, a 7.0 cm long fallopian tube was irregularly dilated up to 4.4 cm in diameter at the ampulary region. The fimbriae were intact. The serosal surphace was smooth. Sections of the dilated part of the fallopian tube revealed a cystic tumor with focally yellow to tan, soft papillary excrescences protruding into the lumen (Fig. ) and foci of intracystic hemorrhage. On microscopic examination the papillae were covered by serous type of epithelium, displaying stratification and budding with focal nuclear atypia (Fig. ). Three types of cells were recognised; ciliated cells, hob-nail cells and mesothelium-like cells. Small foci of tumor tissue necroses and hemorrhage were noted. There was no invasion of the supportive stroma of the papillae or into the fallopian tube wall. Focus of endosalpingiosis within the adjacent mesosalpinx was found. DNA analysis determined by flow cytometry paraffin technique revealed DNA diploid tumor with low S-phase fraction of 6.5 %."
147,776038,658321,597749,"An 18-year old male from Myanmar was brought to the emergency department because of difficulty in swallowing and alteration of consciousness. He had been in good health and had arrived Bangkok 6 days earlier. Three days prior to admission, he developed fever and difficulty in swallowing. He also had pruritus of his right leg and buttock which resulted in extensive excoriation. He had became intermittently confused and refused to eat or drink. There were episodes of agitation and he was reported to have complained of shortness of breath incited by fanning.
One day prior to entry, he was unable to swallow his saliva. His mental status alternated between normal periods and confusion. He gave a history of dog bite 10 years previously but no post exposure vaccination was administered and he denied any recent animal bites or contact with bats.
On admission, he was conscious and well co-operative. He complained of a severely sore throat. He insisted on sitting and continuously spitting out saliva. His body temperature was 39.1°C, blood pressure 130/70 mmHg, heart rate 120 and respiration 30 per minute. There was crepitus on the left side of his neck without signs of inflammation. There were no focal neurological signs. His palatopharyngeal muscle functions were intact but the gag reflex was hyperactive. Aero- and hydrophobic spasms could not be induced. Indirect laryngoscopic examination showed no abnormality. Laboratory studies revealed a leucocytosis of 28,400 with 89.6% of neutrophils. His serum amylase level was slightly elevated (443 U/L, normal range 28–100 U/L). The computerized tomography (CT) scan of the brain was unremarkable. Lumbar puncture revealed an acellular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and normal protein and sugar levels. Lateral neck radiographs showed air in retropharyngeal space (Figure ) and a chest x-ray performed at the same time showed evidence of pneumomediastinum (Figure ). A liquid barium esophagogram failed to show any point of leakage. Surgical consultation was obtained for exploration. Between admission and operation, his mental state was clear and he showed no signs of aggression and the differential diagnosis of possible rabies was disregarded.
Operative findings were unremarkable. There was no evidence of perforation in upper esophagus and oropharynx. Retropharyngeal area was normal without any accumulation of fluid or purulent discharge.
He required assisted ventilation postoperatively but was able to move limbs voluntarily. He remained rational and cooperative. His hypernatremia (Na 157 mOsm/L) was rapidly corrected to140 mOsm/L within the following 11 hours. On the second postoperative day, he developed brief generalized tonic- clonic seizures. Intravenous phenytoin was initiated. Serial seizures developed on day 6. Repeated lumbar puncture and CT scan were unremarkable. He was conscious but failed to communicate. Paralysis of all limbs with absence of deep tendon reflexes was noted on the same day. He became comatose on day 9. Paralytic rabies was then suspected and rabies virus RNA was demonstrable in saliva but not in the urine by nucleic acid sequence based amplification technique (3). The patient died after 12 days of hospitalization (15 days after first clinical onset). Autopsy findings showed wide spread Negri bodies through out the whole neural axis."
148,797624,983319,625844,"An 11-year-old female with a history of migraine headaches and exercise-induced asthma (EIA) was evaluated in the Allergy clinic two months after experiencing symptoms while holding a guinea pig at her hairdresser's home. This was the only episode of symptoms associated with guinea pig exposure; she had handled the pet previously without exhibiting symptoms. Within minutes of holding the guinea pig, she developed ocular itching, lacrimation, and periorbital angioedema. Symptoms rapidly progressed to facial urticaria and angioedema, rhinorrhea, throat tightness, and dyspnea. She had difficulty speaking, repeatedly attempted to clear her throat, and expressed feelings of impending doom. There was no coughing or audible wheezing.
Treatment within 20 minutes included diphenhydramine 25 mg, followed by nebulized albuterol at an urgent care clinic. Although her vital signs were not available, her mother denied she had low blood pressure. The symptoms resolved within two hours without recurrence. Epinephrine and corticosteroids were not administered.
She has since avoided guinea pig exposure and has had no further symptoms other than those related to EIA. She reported previous casual exposure to guinea pigs without adverse reaction, but had not kept any rodents as pets. She denied symptoms on previous exposures to dogs, cats, and other caged rodents.
Her past medical history was significant for episodic bronchitis, croup, sinusitis, and migraine headaches. She had no history of perennial or seasonal rhinitis. Her only medication was propranolol for migraine prophylaxis. Prior and current spirometry was normal. An exercise challenge within the past year was consistent with EIA. Physical examination, at the time of the evaluation, was significant for allergic shiners and pale, swollen inferior nasal turbinates. Her lungs were clear, and the remainder of her examination was normal."
149,807114,218091,590938,"A 24-year-old female smoker with allergic rhinitis, EIA, and known cat-induced rhinitis was evaluated for a several year history of perennial rhinitis and conjunctivitis. She also described an episode of severe allergic symptoms resulting from guinea pig exposure. Within minutes of cleaning her pet guinea pig's cage, she developed throat tightness, severe dyspnea, and anxious feelings. She denied coughing, wheezing, and urticaria. A feeling of ""impending doom"" was not specifically stated. Her symptoms resolved spontaneously one hour after departing outdoors. She did not take medication or seek medical attention.
Her past medical history was significant for irritable bowel syndrome and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Daily medication included sertraline, nasal fluticasone, and oral contraceptives. Physical examination was significant for bilateral serous otitis media and edematous nasal turbinates. Her lungs were clear, and the remainder of her examination was normal. Spirometry was equivocal due to submaximal effort."
150,807114,592626,142978,"A 69 year old lady presented 11 years ago with pain of mild to moderate severity on the right side of her abdomen. This pain was intermittent, described as 'no more than a dull ache' and associated with nausea, bloating and flatulence. She also suffered from constipation and experienced partial relief of her symptoms following defeacation. She reported worsening of her symptoms after a heavy meal, and experienced occasional bouts of steatorrhea. Physical examination revealed mild right-sided abdominal tenderness only.
Apart from the above she was a healthy lady without any co morbidity and no history of previous abdominal surgery. Initial investigations included an abdominal ultrasound scan (USS), a hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan and an oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (OGD), which did not reveal any abnormality. Flexible sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy were also unremarkable. Her pain was thought to be due to a slow transit colon and she was advised to take laxatives on a regular basis, which resulted in partial and temporary relief of her symptoms. Although her condition did not impact her lifestyle significantly, her symptoms never subsided completely and almost two years following initial presentation she underwent an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), a cream absorption test, wheat intolerance test and a CT scan of her abdomen. All of these did not reveal any abnormality and thus irritable bowel syndrome was thought to represent best her condition. She was also advised to take antispasmodics together with various combinations of laxatives and a course of Pancrelipase (Creon) tablets for presumed pancreatic insufficiency, which resulted in only temporary relief.
An opinion of a gastroenterology consultant physician was sought, resulting in another abdominal USS and OGD, as well as a barium follow through study which were all normal and thus she continued to take symptomatic treatment.
Finally, 11 years from presentation, the patient was admitted to hospital with acute small bowel obstruction and underwent a laparotomy within 24 hours of admission after adequate fluid and electrolyte replacement. At the operation a sizable mid-ileum, obstructing tumor was revealed, that was wedge resected with adequate gross margins followed by end to end hand sewn anastomosis. The rest of the laparotomy was unremarkable with no evidence of macroscopic spread of disease.
Histopathological analysis revealed a densely crowded spindle and polygonal cell tumour showing moderate nuclear pleomorphism (Figures and ) . No mitoses were found and the tumour spread into the mucosa and outwards into the serosa. There was no lymph nodal spread. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated positive staining for CD117 (cKit) (figure ), and negative staining for broad range cytokeratins (MNF 116), CD34, desmin, S-100 and chromogranin. Although there were no mitoses, based on the size (80 × 40 × 50 mm), the tumour was classified as a GIST of intermediate malignant potential.
The patient made an uneventful recovery and remarkably, all her previous abdominal symptoms were completely resolved. A CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis performed subsequently did not reveal the presence of metastatic disease. Her case was discussed in our multidisciplinary team meeting and it was decided not to proceed with any adjuvant treatment. At one year follow up our patient was a very happy lady completely free of her abdominal symptoms."
151,816248,558370,203193,"A 59-year-old man was admitted to Coronary Care Unit because of suspected ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction. The patient was complaining of typical coronary chest pain during the last twelve hours. He had a history of dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, smoking habit and a transient ischemic attack without any sensitive or motor squele one year ago. On admission, his blood pressure was 100/60 and heart rate was 110 beats per minute. Cardiac examination revealed jugular vein distension, and no significant heart murmurs. The ECG showed significant Q waves in II, III and aVf leads with mild ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, aVf and V4R. The chest radiograph revealed no cardiomegaly and clear lung fields. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed showing akinetic inferoseptal, inferior, and inferolateral segments with estimated left ventricular ejection fraction of 45%, right ventricle showed a global hipokinesia with severe systolic dysfunction and inferior vena cava plethora. The patient was initially treated with aspirin, low-molecular-weight heparin, dobutamine and saline infusions, and was scheduled for early catheterization. Coronary angiography showed total occlusion of right coronary artery proximal segment and two additional 70% stenoses in the first diagonal and obtuse marginal branches. Percutaneous revascularization was dismissed after a failed attempt of right coronary artery opening, then, the patient was treated using conservative medical therapy (aspirin 100 mg/day, clopidogrel 75 mg/day, simvastatin 20 mg/day and enalapril 10 mg/day), anticoagulation was maintained for 72 hours, and beta blocker therapy was not started because Mobitz I atrioventricular block phases were detected in continuous ECG monitoring. The later clinical outcome in the Coronary Care Unit was favourable, and the patient was discharged six days after to cardiology hospitalization unit. Nine days after hospital admission, the patient complained about sudden chest pain and rest dyspnea, his blood pressure was 80/40 and cardiac examination revealed a new harsh, holosystolic murmur along the left sternal border. Transthoracic echocardiography was immediately performed showing complex ventricular septal defect with a dissection tract that originated on left side of the basal inferoseptal akinetic segments, extended beyond the septum dissecting the right ventricular wall, and subsequently re-entered into the right ventricle chamber (figures , and ). No significant right ventricle outflow tract obstruction was present. The patient was scheduled for immediate surgical intervention, and hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass with myocardial protection was established in the following two hours. The septal rupture was approached through the infarct, and prosthetic material (Gore-Tex® patch) was used to reconstruct the septum, additionally, two bypasses using vein grafts were done in first diagonal and posterior descending arteries. Postoperative evolution was favourable with rapid resolution of cardiogenic shock situation. One month later transesophageal echocardiography was performed (figure , Panel C) showing neither right ventricle dissecting tract or residual shunt. Left ventricular ejection fraction was 55%, and right ventricular systolic function was only mildly depressed. At six-month follow-up the patient remains stable and without any cardiac symptoms."
152,816248,844303,804790,"A 25 year old woman (G2P1) at 20 weeks gestation was in her usual state of good health until 2 weeks prior to hospital presentation. She developed progressive inter-scapular pain followed by lower extremity paresthesias. On the day of admission she noted severe weakness in both legs which developed over the course of 3–4 hours, resulting in the inability to ambulate. She denied fever, rigors, nausea, emesis, or diarrhea prior to admission. She also reported urinary hesitancy for 2–3 days prior to admission, with loss of bladder control on the day of admission. There was no loss of bowel control. At the time of hospital presentation, she was awake, alert, oriented, and not in acute cardiopulmonary distress. The vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 134/82 mmHg, temperature 97.8°F, pulse 76/minute, and a respiratory rate of 18/minute. She was unable to stand or ambulate. Physical exam revealed ascending sensory deficits to the T4 region below her breasts. Ankle reflexes were absent bilaterally. Patellar reflexes were 1/4 bilaterally and Babinski reflexes were up-going bilaterally. Initial laboratory data revealed a leukocytosis of 18,600/μL (normal 3,700–9,700/μL) hemoglobin of 10.4 gm/dL (normal 12.0–15,0 gm/dl), and electrolytes were within normal limits. Blood cultures were not obtained at time of admission.
An MRI of the thoracic spine, performed at the time of presentation, revealed an irregular mass-like density predominantly at the T1 and T2 levels, with a hyper-intense and serpiginous contour demonstrated in the epidural space (Figure ). Spinal cord volume loss due to compression was noted in the upper thoracic segments. Owing to the spinal cord compression and associated neurologic symptoms, an emergent laminectomy was performed. Operative tissue samples were sent for pathology and microbiologic analysis. Histopathology revealed nonspecific chronic, active inflammation. Gram stain of the specimens was negative. Operative wound cultures grew Streptococcus milleri on the 3rd post-operative day. Two sets (2 anaerobic and 2 aerobic collection bottles) of blood cultures obtained upon receiving the results of the wound cultures and prior to initiating antibiotic therapy were negative. Vaginal cultures were not obtained either prior or post-operatively to determine if the patient was colonized with SMG.
The patient was treated with ceftriaxone 2 gm IV daily for 28 days. An MRI of the abdomen and pelvis revealed no focal fluid collections or abscesses. A transesophageal echocardiogram revealed no valvular pathology. She was discharged to home after 21 days and was able to ambulate with the assistance of a walker. At the time of hospital discharge, partial improvement in the sensory deficit was noted. Six weeks after initial therapy, residual sensory and motor deficits persisted, requiring the patient to ambulate with the aid of a walker. The patient gave birth to a healthy baby boy by vaginal delivery. Ten months after the initial presentation, the patient was ambulating without a walker and had near complete recovery of both the motor and sensory deficits."
153,828582,907946,887460,"A 5-year-old boy with a two-day history of fever, vomiting and poor intake was brought to the emergency room of Veterans General Hospital-Kaohsiung, Taiwan in April 2002. He had cough for 2 days before the onset of fever and had visited a pediatric clinic, where oral antibiotics were prescribed. No otitis media or sinusitis was noted upon admission. He also had no prior hospitalizations or any major systemic illness in the past. On admission, his vital signs consisted of a temperature of 38.6°C (ear), pulse rate 108/min, respiratory rate 60/min and blood pressure of 134/87 mmHg. The physical examination revealed a drowsy child with nuchal rigidity and a positive Kernig sign. The Glascow Coma Scale was E1V1 M6. Chest radiography was normal. A lumbar puncture revealed an opening pressure of > 400 mmHg. The total white blood cell count of the CSF was 66/mm3, with 28% neutrophils, 68% lymphocytes, and 4% monocytes. The glucose and protein were 11 mg/dL and 596 mg/dL, respectively. Numerous gram-positive cocci in pairs were seen on microscopic examination. CSF and blood and nasopharyngeal cultures were positive for S. pneumoniae. The C-reactive protein was 12.3 mg/dL (normal <1 mg/dL). The immunoglobulin profile was within normal limits. The patient was intubated. Cefotaxime 200 mg/Kg/D and vancomycin 60 mg/Kg/D were administered immediately after lumbar puncture was performed. Dexamethasone 0.6 mg/Kg/D was also administered prior to the parenteral antibiotics and continued for 4 days. The isolates obtained from blood, nasopharynx and CSF demonstrated an MIC to penicillin of 4 μg/mL. A follow-up lumbar puncture was performed 72 hours after admission. The CSF glucose was 52 mg/dL and protein was 292 mg/dL with a lowered opening pressure. Vancomycin and cefotaxime were administered for a total of 15 days. He became afebrile on the 7th day. He was gradually weaned from the ventilator and fully recovered without neurological sequelae."
154,828582,488367,129433,"A 38-year-old male underwent a hiking tour on a hot, humid day in late July 2003. At the end of this exhausting trip he complained of dizziness, finally falling into an 'apathic' state. On the arrival of the emergency physician, the patient suffered from a generalized epileptic seizure. Subsequently, the comatose patient (Glasgow Coma Scale 6 (E 1, V 1, M 4)) developed respiratory insufficiency and cardiovascular failure (blood pressure 60/20 mmHg, heart rate 166/min). He was immediately intubated (using fentanyl (0.3 mg), etomidate (40 mg) and midazolam (20 mg)) and transported to our neurological intensive care unit (NICU).
On admission, the patient was deeply sedated and under analgesia, but still suffering from hypotension requiring immediate use of catecholamines (norepinephrine). The patient had normal weight (body mass index = 24) and no significant previous medical history. The initial cerebral computed tomography (CT) scan in combination with CT angiography did not reveal any pathologies and, to exclude an infectious origin for the central nervous system dysfunction, a lumbar puncture was carried out yielding normal cerebrospinal fluid. An initial extensive laboratory work up revealed impaired liver function (glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase 312U/l (normal range: 10 to 50 U/l), glutamic-pyruvic transaminase 244 U/l (normal range: 10 to 50 U/l), gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase 94 U/l (normal range: 10 to 66 U/l) and a prothrombin time of 60% (normal range: 70 to 130%). Serum creatinine levels as well as blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were elevated (creatinine 2.6 mg/100 ml (normal range: 0.8 to 1.3 mg/100 ml) and BUN 30 mg/100 ml (normal range: 5 to 25 mg/100 ml)) indicating the beginning of renal failure. This situation was further complicated by rhabdomyolysis with elevation of myoglobin and creatine kinase (CK) (myoglobin peak level 33.124 μg/l (day 2), normal range: 0 to 116 μg/l) and CK peak level 102.4 U/l (day 4), normal range: 38 to 174 U/l.
At the time of admission, core body temperature measured by urinary bladder probe (Foley catheter; Kendall Curity, Mansfield, MA, USA), was 40.8°C. During the first 20 h of treatment, conventional temperature control methods including high-dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (acetylsalicylic acid 1000 mg and paracetamol 2000 mg) and opioids (pethidine 100 mg), as well as external cooling devices such as cooling blankets (Blanketrol II®, Cincinnati Sub-Zero, Cincinnati, OH, USA) and Bair Hugger® (Arizant Healthcare Inc, Eden Prairie, MN, USA), which were applied for 8 h, did not lead to any significant decrease in core body temperature (Figure ). Because of subsequent deterioration of the patient's condition and insufficient conventional temperature control, an aggressive treatment approach with a novel intravascular cooling system (CoolGard 3000® and Cool Line™, Alsius, Irvine, CA, USA) was begun. The heat-exchange catheter (Cool Line™) was placed into the left superior vena cava and cooled saline was infused through a closed loop system into two heat-exchange balloons located near the distal end of the catheter. The temperature of the saline solution was adjusted automatically by the CoolGard 3000®, which is an external temperature control unit, according to feedback to the external pump/refrigerant device from a microthermister attached to a Foley bladder catheter. Target temperature was set at 37°C for the first 25 h of intravascular treatment and subsequently at 37.5°C. Target temperature was reached within 7 h at a maximum cooling rate of 0.6°C/h and 'cooling' was prolonged at this level.
Multiple organ dysfunction and secondary rhabdomyolysis led to increased levels of myoglobin and CK (myoglobin peak level 33.124 μg/l (day 2), CK peak level 102.4 U/l (day 4)). To prevent imminent renal failure, forced diuresis was initiated and continued for 40 h using high-dose furosemide and fluids, resulting in an urinary excretion rate of more than 400 ml/h, leading to a fluid turnover of up to 24,000 ml/24 h. With this aggressive measure, we suceeded in avoiding the use of extracorporal hemofiltration and the renal parameters returned to normal values within 3 days.
Core body temperature was maintained at about 37°C and subsequently maintained at 37.5°C (± 0.2°C) with the use of the intravascular catheter over the next 5 days (Figure ). Several attempts to stop the active cooling within this period (Figure ) led to an immediate steep increase of core body temperature, which forced us to prolong this very efficacious endovascular treatment. Finally, after 111.5 h, CoolGard® treatment was stopped, since most of the laboratory parameters had stabilized; the patient did not suffer from hyperthermia thereafter.
To confirm the diagnosis of severe heat stroke and to measure the systemic inflammatory response [], we analyzed levels of plasma cytokines and serum chemokines 60 h after admission. The results are shown in Table : soluble interleukin (IL) receptor (sIL-2R) 1500 pg/ml, IL-4 3 pg/ml, IL-6 204 pg/ml, IL-8 40 pg/ml and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) 38 pg/ml (IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, TNF alpha analyzed by immunoenzymometric assay, Biosource, Nivelles, Belgium; IL-2R analyzed by immunoenzymometric assay, Immunotec, Marseille, France). On days 5 and 7 after admission, the values of IL-6 had decreased to 96 pg/ml (day 5) and 34 pg/ml (day 7), respectively.
Initially diagnosed aspiration pneumonia as well as sinusitis maxillaris diagnosed on the initial cerebral CT scan, were treated with tazobactam/piperacilline and clindamycin. On day 3, somatosensoric potentials did not show any pathologic results. The patient was extubated on day 8 and transferred to a regular neurological ward on day 12 with neither signs of any focal neurological nor overt cognitive deficits. At the time of discharge from the NICU, laboratory parameters had returned to normal values."
155,832410,79871,856164,"A 74-year-old female with a history of severe aortic stenosis and interventricular septal hypertrophy underwent bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement with concomitant septal myectomy. Two months after the surgical intervention she presented to another hospital with syncope. On presentation, it was described that this obese patient was bradycardic with a heart rate of 40 beats per minute with stable blood pressure readings. No jugular venous distention was noted and occasional cannon A waves were noted. Examination of the lungs revealed adequate aeration in all fields with no crackles or wheezing. Point of maximum impulse was not displaced. Regular heart sounds with variable intensity were noted with no atrial or ventricular gallops but an early systolic murmur grade II/VI was described noted at the left sternal border. Due to the symptomatic bradycardia a dual chamber pacemaker was recommended and placed without complications. The patient was subsequently discharged home 24 hours after the pacemaker implantation. Four months post pacemaker implantation she was seen in follow-up and she doing fine and reported no complaints. An echocardiogram was obtained and it was reported that normal left ventricular systolic function as well as prosthetic aortic valve function were noted, with no other abnormalities.
The patient then relocated and was seen a year later for the first time at our institution. An echocardiogram obtained at the time of her initial visit, while still asymptomatic, showed normal left ventricular chamber dimensions, systolic function, and bioprosthetic valve function. In addition, a pacer wire that was correctly positioned in the right ventricular apex was also seen. However, an abnormal color flow signal arising from the interventricular septum with a predominant flow away from the transducer into the left ventricular cavity was noted. Continuous and pulse wave Doppler interrogation demonstrated a continuous flow with a predominant diastolic component, as shown in Figures , and , all these findings consistent with coronary arterial flow. This abnormal color flow signal, traversing the interventricular septum, was never identified in previous studies.
The patient presented in this case was asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis and consequently no intervention was recommended. The patient was seen in follow-up and was doing fine, reporting no complaints."
156,832410,753730,356157,"A 34-year old lady presented with intermittent lower abdominal pain associated with abdominal distension for five months. There was no history of gastrointestinal bleeding, nausea or vomiting and the bowel habits were normal. There was no history of seizures, mental retardation, behaviour problems, and skin abnormalities suggestive of tuberous sclerosis. She had undergone a caesarean section, seven months back. On examination there was a midline reducible incisional hernia with minimal tenderness in the right iliac fossa.
Computed tomography scan demonstrated an unexplained right iliac fossa density, which could represent a caecal or pericaecal abnormality (figure ). An infraumbilical incisional hernia containing bowel loops was also seen. Colonoscopy showed erythema at the ileo-caecal junction. Biopsies from this area were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the presence of the mass in the right iliac fossa. It was separate from the caecum and lying inferior to it. The differential diagnosis was an inflammatory mass or a pedunculated lesion from the small bowel such as a pedunculated tumour or even a Meckel's diverticulum. Both ovaries were normal. Operative findings were that of a retroperitoneal mass. Excision of the mass was done with repair of the hernia.
Macroscopically, the tumour was well circumscribed with a thin fibrous capsule and the consistency was soft. The cut surface showed lobules of fatty tissue with bands and nodules of firm white tissue with a whorled appearance (figure ).
Microscopic examination (figure ) showed a lesion composed of lobules of mature fatty tissue harbouring multiple variable sized nodules of smooth muscle fibres. The smooth muscle fibres were arranged in broad interlacing fascicles. No cytological atypia was seen and only one mitotic figure was identified in the multiple sections examined and no necrosis. No proliferation of medium-sized arteries with thick muscular walls was observed. The spindle cells were positive for smooth muscle actin and desmin and negative for CD34 and CD117 (figure ). The staining for HMB-45 was not performed, as blocks were not available. The features were those of benign myolipoma (lipoleiomyoma)."
157,833506,651417,982515,"A forty-year-old female was referred to our department for evaluation of elevated liver enzymes in May, 2004. She had no systemic symptoms. A year before, she had had a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Since then, she had been on hormone replacement therapy with estrogen. Six months ago, during her routine follow-up, elevation of transaminase levels was noted. This elevation persisted for the next 6 months. She was then referred to our department for further investigation.
Laboratory features of the patient regarding this period are shown in Table . Detailed questioning of the patient revealed no history of past alcohol abuse. Screening for viral antigens and for antibodies against them, as well as screening for viral nucleotide-acid sequences (including HCV-RNA/-cDNA PCR), found no evidence of infection. Levels of auto-antibodies, serum transferrin saturation, serum ferritin, serum ceruloplasmin, serum copper, serum α1-antitrypsin, and 24-hour urinary copper excretion were either negative or within normal limits. Abdominal ultrasonography was unremarkable. Doppler ultrasound imaging of portal and hepatic veins and the hepatic artery revealed no thrombosis.
A liver biopsy was performed. Histopathological examination revealed focal necrosis and mild fibrotic activity. Macrovesicular steatosis affecting 5% of hepatocytes, in addition to several foci of prominent nuclear pleomorphism and hyperchromasia were also noted. However, the most remarkable finding was the presence of abundant intracytoplasmic, sharply bordered, pale eosinophilic inclusions that exhibited a ground-glass appearance (Figure ). Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), diastase-treated PAS and colloidal iron stains were applied. Immunohistochemistry for hepatitis B surface (mouse monoclonal antibody clone: Tg, Neomarkers) and core (mouse monoclonal antibody clone: Tordji-22, Signet) antigens, α1-antitrypsin (rabbit antibody, Zymed), fibrinogen (rabbit anti-human antibody, Dako), α fetoprotein (rabbit polyclonal antibody, Signet), complement 3 (mouse monoclonal antibody clone: HAV 3–4, Dako) and complement 4 (rabbit anti-human antibody, Dako) were performed. A three-step streptavidin biotin method using AEC as chromogen was applied in the immunohistochemical procedure. The inclusions were negative to PAS and colloidal iron. No reactivity with antibodies against hepatitis antigens, α1-antitrypsin and complement 3 was observed. Diffuse and strong positivity was observed for fibrinogen in cytoplasmic inclusions (Figure ). We also detected less positivity for complement 4 and α-fetoprotein.
Paraffin-embedded tissue was processed for electron microscopic examination. Ultrastructurally, the inclusions were found to be moderately electron-dense, finely granular, homogenous bodies that are encircled by membranes, corresponding to a dilated endoplasmic reticulum (Figure ). There were no parallel arrays of tubular structures in the inclusions.
Serum fibrinogen level was within normal limits. We performed tests for qualitative fibrinogen function. Prothrombine time, partial thromboplastin time and thrombin time were also within normal limits. The patient had no history of prolonged bleeding episodes, menorrhagia, or epistaxis. Since infectious, auto-immune or metabolic diseases were excluded, a drug effect was suspected. Therefore, estrogen therapy was ceased and the patient was followed monthly in order to check transaminase levels. Her serum transaminase levels decreased gradually at each monthly visit and normalized at the third month. Then we decided to perform a control liver biopsy. Parenchymal and portal inflammation, steatosis and necroinflammatory activity were remarkably reduced in the second liver biopsy (Figure ). Again, the same staining procedures were applied. Compared to the first biopsy, fibrinogen positive inclusions decreased dramatically to the point where only one hepatocyte contained an inclusion. Fibrotic activity and nuclear dysplastic findings remained almost the same."
158,833506,532393,290481,"Patient 793 (male Caucasian, 39 years old) had excision of a ""low risk"" primary melanoma [superficial spreading type with early vertical growth phase present; the tumor thickness was 0.55 mm and the vertical growth phase had a brisk lymphoid infiltrate, with no evidence of metastases]. The primary lesion was excised ~20 years ago and there has been no recurrence since. The patient did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy after removal of the primary lesion."
159,841998,489557,173292,"A 62 year-old woman underwent a left lumpectomy in April of 2001 which revealed invasive carcinoma, histologically classified as ductal type.
The 2.3 cm invasive carcinoma was well to moderately differentiated with intermediate nuclear grade. Well-formed ducts comprised greater than 90% of the invasive carcinoma (Figure ). In some areas, tumor cells assumed a linear growth pattern and contained intracytoplasmic mucin vacuoles (Figure , inset). The invasive carcinoma was estrogen and progesterone receptor positive by immunohistochemistry. Lobular carcinoma in-situ (LCIS), mostly of the classical type with some foci having pleomorphic features and apocrine cytology was also present. In areas, classical LCIS extended into adjacent ducts in a pagetoid distribution. A single axillary lymph node was involved by metastatic carcinoma composed of tumor cells in a diffuse, discohesive pattern characteristic of metastatic lobular carcinoma. Focal gland formation was also evident in this metastatic deposit. Intracytoplasmic mucin vacuoles were readily identified within tumor cells.
An E-cadherin immunohistochemical stain was performed on representative samples of invasive, in-situ, and metastatic carcinoma. No cell membrane reactivity was demonstrated in the primary invasive carcinoma or in the nodal metastasis including areas of glandular differentiation (Figure and ). Complete absence of E-cadherin immunoreactivity was also seen in foci of LCIS.
In this case, aberrant E-cadherin protein expression was represented by absence of cell membrane immunoreactivity in gland-forming regions of invasive as well as metastatic carcinoma which appeared to be phenotypically ""ductal""."
160,841998,345694,252221,"A 60 year-old female presented with a left breast mass. Subsequent excisional biopsy revealed invasive duct carcinoma.
The lumpectomy specimen contained an 8 mm invasive well-differentiated duct carcinoma. Although greater than 90% of the tumor exhibited glandular differentiation, very focal areas with a single cell and linear growth pattern were also present (Figure ). The invasive carcinoma was estrogen and progesterone receptor positive and negative for HER-2/neu protein overexpression by immunohistochemistry. In-situ carcinoma was ductal in type with cribriform architecture and low nuclear grade arising predominantly in a background of typical and atypical columnar cell hyperplasia. Classical LCIS that expanded lobules with central discohesion was also present. The re-excisional specimen revealed additional foci of LCIS and no invasive carcinoma. An ipsilateral sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed. The lymph node was involved by metastatic carcinoma with a diffuse, discohesive growth pattern characteristic of lobular carcinoma. A minority of the tumor (<5%) also showed glandular differentiation.
The immunohistochemical stain for E-cadherin showed weak cell membrane reactivity in areas of the primary invasive carcinoma exhibiting a ductal phenotype (Figure ). In contrast, areas of invasive carcinoma with a linear, ""lobular"" phenotype displayed strong, uniform cell membrane staining (not shown). Diffuse, strong and uniform immunoreactivity was also seen in the nodal metastasis (Figure ).
Foci of intraductal carcinoma demonstrated moderate positivity for E-cadherin while those of classical LCIS were negative for this antigen.
In this case, aberrant E-cadherin protein expression consisted of weak immunoreactivity in the ""ductal"" areas of invasive carcinoma, whereas strong positivity was appreciated in areas of invasive and metastatic carcinoma with a lobular histologic phenotype."
161,842169,772130,822830,"A 62 year-old woman presented with a right breast mass. Stereotactic needle core biopsy revealed an invasive, moderately differentiated carcinoma that was classified as ductal. Subsequent wide local excision included the needle core biopsy site as well as an area of radiographic density not previously sampled.
The excisional biopsy revealed two separate invasive tumors measuring 8 and 5 mm, respectively. Well-formed glands comprised 80–90% of both tumors. Adjacent classical LCIS was also present. The larger tumor was strongly positive for estrogen and progesterone receptors by immunohistochemistry. No membrane expression for HER-2/neu was appreciated. A single ipsilateral sentinel lymph node contained several cytokeratin-positive cells. Five additional axillary lymph nodes were free of metastatic disease.
The immunohistochemical stain for E-cadherin of the larger tumor was weak and discontinuous (Figure ). There was no E-cadherin cell membrane reactivity in the smaller invasive carcinoma (Figure ) or in adjacent LCIS (not shown). An E-cadherin stain was not performed on the sentinel lymph node.
Aberrant E-cadherin protein expression in this case consisted of predominantly negative immunoreactivity in invasive tumors exhibiting a ductal histological phenotype.
A 57 year-old woman presented with a mass in the left breast.
The excised specimen contained a 2.9 cm invasive and in-situ poorly differentiated carcinoma. More than 90% of the tumor consisted of invasive carcinoma which exhibited predominantly alveolar and solid growth patterns, absence of gland formation, and intermediate-high nuclear grade (Figure , left). In-situ carcinoma comprised the remainder of the tumor mass and had a solid growth pattern, apocrine features, and intermediate-high nuclear grade. Both invasive and in-situ carcinoma formed signet-ring cells containing bluish-tinged, intracytoplasmic mucin vacuoles and together with the nuclear atypia, had the appearance of pleomorphic lobular carcinoma. The invasive carcinoma showed nuclear reactivity for estrogen and progesterone receptors by immunohistochemistry. The subsequent left mastectomy specimen revealed residual invasive carcinoma. A single, 2.2 cm left axillary lymph node contained metastatic carcinoma with extranodal extension. Morphologically, the metastatic deposit showed a ""lobular phenotype"" in the form of signet-ring cells growing in a diffuse distribution and absence of glandular differentiation (Figure , left).
An E-cadherin immunohistochemical stain performed on the primary invasive carcinoma revealed a heterogeneous staining pattern. Tumor areas with alveolar and solid growth patterns exhibited strong, continuous cell membrane immunoreactivity (Figure , right) while those having a linear growth pattern had relatively weaker, discontinuous positivity (not shown). Additionally, some tumor cells demonstrated a punctate staining pattern either within the cell membrane or cytoplasm (Figure ). Overall, the E-cadherin reactivity was interpreted as positive in areas of invasive carcinoma despite heterogeneous staining in some areas. Metastatic carcinoma involving the lymph node demonstrated strong, continuous membrane staining (Figure , right).
Aberrant staining in this case consisted of strong E-cadherin protein expression in areas of primary invasive carcinoma morphologically resembling pleomorphic lobular carcinoma. Weaker, discontinuous E-cadherin positivity was observed in other areas of the invasive carcinoma resembling classical type of lobular carcinoma. Punctate membrane or cytoplasmic staining by E-cadherin was also observed in some tumor cells. The lymph node metastasis which also had a ""lobular"" appearance had strong membrane E-cadherin reactivity similar to that seen in the primary invasive carcinoma."
162,842169,598394,527328,"A 40-year-old female with negative smoking and medical history was admitted with productive cough, progressively aggravating dyspnea on exertion, and recurrent pulmonary infections for the previous 2 months. The chest X-ray showed total atelectasis of the left lung (Figure ), and the thoracic CT-scan revealed a mass of the left hemithorax, which probably originated in the mediastinum and extended to the whole left pleural space (Figure ). The mass showed heterogeneous density containing soft tissue elements, fat, cystic areas and foci of calcification, which is the classic imaging appearance of a benign teratoma on CT. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to specify the anatomic relationships and confirm the tumor morphologic features. The MRI yielded useful information about the vital structures of the mediastinum, whether invaded or externally compressed by the tumor. Specifically, the MRI confirmed a round, non-homogeneous, well circumscribed mass of a 12 cm diameter, exerting compression on the mediastinum great vessels and the left hilar structures (vessels and airway) (Figure ). The bronchoscopy found stenosis of the trachea by external compression, and narrowing in the foramen of the left main bronchus resulting in difficulty in the insertion of the bronchoscope. The mediastinal tumor markers (α-fetoprotein and β-human chorionic gonadotropin) were both normal. As the findings of CT and MRI suggested a benign teratoma, a complete resection was contemplated. Since the mass was supposed to be respectable, surgical management was first in the priority list of therapeutic options. The cytological examination through transcutaneous needle aspiration or biopsy of the tumor were considered redundant and were omitted, because of the dispersion risk and the necessity for total removal so as to ameliorate the respiratory function and re-expand the left lung. Moreover, needle biopsy allows examination of only a small amount of tissue and may be inadequate for definitive diagnosis []. As already underlined in the literature, diagnosis and therapy rely on surgical excision, and even with large sized tumors whose complete resection is impossible, partial resection still relieves symptoms, frequently without relapse []. Pulmonary function tests were impaired: FVC 1.19 (36.7% of predicted) and FEV1 1.01 (41.5% of predicted), whereas a-FP, βCG were normal.
The patient underwent a total resection of the mediastinal mass via a left posterolateral thoracotomy. Entry into the pleural space was performed through the fifth intercostal space, and, because of the tumor large size, extension of the incision was necessary to obtain safe visualization of the cavity and proceed to tumor mobilization. Approaching via left thoracotomy makes access to the mediastinal structures difficult but permits control of the whole hemithorax up to the hilar structures. Many adhesions existed with the left pulmonary artery, the left main bronchus, the pericardium, the aorta, and the diaphragm, and a combination of blunt and sharp dissection for the division was applied uneventfully. Because of difficulty in the mobilization of such a huge mass, a purse string suture permitted aspiration of sebaceous content via a small incision in the wall. As the size diminished, manipulation was facilitated. The tumor, excised en block, was white-gray colored, well circumscribed, and thick capsuled. A tube thoracostomy was introduced, the collapsed left lung was easily re-expanded, and the patient was extubated. The patient recovered well from the operation and was discharged on the 2nd postoperative day. Preoperative atelectasis of the left lung was totally resolved (Figure ), and the pathological examination revealed a benign mature teratoma with dermoid cyst characteristics, containing sebaceous and gelatinous material. Two years later, the patient is doing well out of recurrence."
163,871623,255108,869118,"A 46 year-old man with HIV/AIDS (CD4 T-cell 115 × 106/l) presented with two weeks of left 5th digit pain and swelling. He denied any history of recent trauma to the hand, fever, weight loss, or other systemic symptoms, but did note an occasional dry cough. He had traveled repeatedly between his native country Ivory Coast, West Africa and the United States. He was not taking antiretroviral medications at the time of presentation. On physical exam his fifth digit was swollen and erythematous at the proximal intraphalangeal joint [figure ]. His laboratory values on admission were as follows: white blood cell count 5000 cells/mm3, hemoglobin 11.6 grams/dl, hematocrit 33.9%, platelets 280,000 platelets/mm3, eosinophils 9.0%, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 60 mm/hour. Left hand radiography was significant for soft tissue swelling over the left finger with joint space narrowing and cortical lucencies with cystic degenerative changes in the proximal phalanx [figure ]. Admission chest radiography demonstrated right hilar lymph node enlargement with multiple scattered nodules and a resolving right lower lobe infiltrate. Computed tomography scan of the chest revealed multiple pulmonary nodules [figure ], necrotic lymph nodes, and splenomegaly. The patient underwent incision, drainage, and biopsy of the affected finger. Operative findings were significant for purulent, mottled, soft, yellow bone.
Rare acid-fast bacilli were demonstrated on biopsy of the both phalanx and synovial fluid samples [figure ]. We used the Gen-PROBE® Amplified Mycobacterium tuberculosis Direct Test which employs a transcription-mediated amplification and hybridization protection assay to qualitatively detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Several weeks later cultures of all surgical material grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis [figure ]. Multiple Ziehl-Neelsen stains of induced sputum samples were negative for acid-fast bacilli, but all specimens sent for sputum culture grew Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Antituberculous treatment was initiated with rifampin, isoniazid, pyrizinamide, and ethambutol prior to culture results. After 12 weeks of treatment, marked improvement in the finger lesion was noted [figure ]."
164,871623,353937,372010,"A 63 year old male patient presented with a large 8 × 8 cm ulcerated and suppurating tumour of the scalp (Fig. ). The patient had suffered from an electrical burn at the age of 5 with delayed and incomplete healing of the wound and subsequent baldness in the healed area. The wound had never been completely healed and ulcerated again 8 weeks before admission to the hospital. The patient, a professor of philosophy, wore a turban for decades to hide the chronic wound. Due to personal neglect and the circumstance that he had been living on his own for many years, without any relatives or a partner kept him from seeing a doctor. The disease only received medical attention when he suddenly experienced a complete aphasia during lectures.
Clinically there was a palpable mass adherent to the skull. Nuclear magnetic resonance and computed tomography imaging revealed a tumour with infiltration of the cranium and the brain (Fig. ). Radical resection of the tumour including the cranium, as well as dura mater and the affected parts of the frontal cortex was performed. The dural defect was closed with an autologous fascia lata patch from the right thigh, and as recipient vessels, the superficial temporal artery and vein were dissected. A radial forearm flap with a 10 × 10 cm skin paddle was harvested with an adequately long vascular pedicle. Radial artery and vein were anastomosed end-to-end to the superficial temporal vessels above the zygomatic arch. The donor site was covered with a split thickness skin graft from the thigh (Fig. ). Histology of the specimen revealed a squamous cell carcinoma and free resectional margins. Postoperative healing was uneventful and the patient regained his speech immediately after the operation (Fig. ). Six weeks later, the patient was referred to our unit again with multiple satellite nodules around the radial forearm free flap (Fig. ). Incision biopsy revealed recurrence of squamous cell carcinoma. In a second operation, radical excision of the scalp with wide margins was performed, requiring sufficient soft tissue coverage. The skin and soft tissue of the radial forearm flap was completely resected, but the proximal part of the radial vessels which were in sufficient distance from the tumour were preserved. Thus radial artery and vein served as recipient vessels for a latissimus dorsi free flap. After the second operation postoperative healing was uneventful again, and the patient recovered well initially for the first three weeks (Fig. and ). Postoperatively, radiation therapy with single focus dose of 14 Gray was administered and one cycle of combined chemotherapy was conducted with cisplatin 180 mg i.v. on day 1 and 5-fluorouracil 1800 mg i.v. on days 1–5 continuously. However despite these efforts, six weeks after the second resection the patient again developed multiple recurrent metastatic lesions around the latissimus dorsi flap, and cerebral symptoms. Clinically, the general condition of the patient dramatically worsened and he died within two more weeks."
165,879757,53671,455309,"A 49-year-old woman with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was admitted to the hospital because of fever for several hours. The patient had been treated for lymphoma since 3 months ago. Five days before admission, the patient was treated with the third cycle of CHOP plus rituximab (R-CHOP). She had no history of travel or contact with animals including cows or their products. Physical examination revealed high fever of 39.8°C. The patient had a subclavian cuffed-CVC(Hickman catheter) on the right side with no evidence of the inflammation at the exit site. Laboratory data and chest radiograph were within normal limits. Three sets of blood samples for cultures were drawn through CVC lines (2 sets) and a peripheral vein (1 set), respectively. The patient was treated empirically with vancomycin (1 g every 12 h intravenously). On the second hospital day, all 3 sets of blood cultures grew gram-positive, acid-fast bacilli. The cultures from the CVC became positive more than 2 hours earlier than that from a peripheral vein. Non-pigmented and pinpoint-shaped colonies were observed on blood or chocolate agar plate after 3 days of incubation at 37°C. It did not grow well on McConkey agar plate. As it grows, the color of the colonies becomes pale-yellow. Vancomycin was replaced by imipenem/cilastatin (500 mg every 6 h intravenously) and amikacin (375 mg every 12 h intravenously). On the sixth hospital day, the CVC was removed because of persistent fever. After removal of CVC, the patient became afebrile and the repeated blood cultures became negative. In vitro susceptibility test was performed by broth microdilution test as described by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS) guidelines []. The result of in vitro susceptibility test was shown in Table . The isolates were susceptible to most antimicrobial agents tested except vancomycin. The patient was further treated with oral ciprofloxacin (500 mg every 12 hours) and doxycycline (100 mg every 12 hours) for 4 weeks. She had been doing well with no evidence of recurrence for the next 3 months."
166,879757,332093,131154,"A 36-year-old, healthy male was accidentally sprayed over the face and trunk with the liquid form of DMAB (). He kept on working and did not take a shower until > 1 hr later. He developed dizziness, nausea, vomiting, sore throat, limb numbness, slurred speech, slow motion, lack of concentration, and ataxia by the next morning, 13 hr after exposure. He was admitted to a local hospital, where a normal brain computerized tomogram was noted. Because of worsening clinical conditions, including “masked” face, irritability, awkwardness, and rocking from side to side while sitting on the bed, he was transferred to our hospital 3 days later. Physical examination revealed some abnormal neurologic findings. The patient was oriented as to time and place but was easily distracted. His speech was slurred. Normal muscle power was noted for all four limbs. He could stand on a wide base with assistance but deviated to both sides when attempting a tandem gait. Impairment on finger-to-nose and heel-to-knee tests was also noted. He denied any medical problems such as hypertension, diabetes, and neurologic diseases. He smoked one pack of cigarettes per day and drank alcohol occasionally.
A routine laboratory work-up including complete blood cell count, electrolytes, blood sugar, and hepatic and renal function tests was performed. Mild hyperventilation, with arterial blood gas of pH 7.510, partial pressure of carbon dioxide 30.6 mm Hg, partial pressure of oxygen 100 mm Hg, and bicarbonate 24.7 mmol/L, was found. No drug history, including use of herbal medicine, was noted for the last 3 months. Urinalysis did not detect any illegal drugs, central nervous system-acting drugs, or other medications. Normal blood and urine lead, mercury, and aluminum levels were also noted.
Eight days after chemical exposure, the patient’s electroencephalogram (EEG) revealed diffuse background slowing, indicative of a mild diffuse cerebral dysfunction. Tests of nerve conduction velocity (NCV) for the left-side limbs were normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on the eighth day showed a symmetric increase in signal intensity on FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery), T2WI (T2-weighted intensity), and DWI (diffusion-weighted images), but low signal intensity on T1WI without postcontrast enhancement at bilateral cerebellar periventricular areas (). A steroid was prescribed for treatment of the possible acute inflammatory effects on neurons. The patient was discharged with stable neurologic function after 6 days of observation.
The pateint was readmitted to our neurology outpatient clinic 18 days after chemical exposure due to difficulty in walking and climbing. Physical examination revealed that the deep tendon reflexes of both knees were areflexic. Muscle power was mildly decreased in the distal and proximal parts of the upper right leg. Lower leg weakness and drop foot were also found bilaterally with muscle power of grade 2/5 in the right foot and 3/5 in the left foot. A nerve conduction study on the 29th day after poisoning showed decreased NCV and complex muscular action potential (CMAP) amplitudes for the left median, left ulnar, left peroneal, and left tibial nerves. H-reflex was absent bilaterally. Sensory conduction and sensory evoked potential tests of the nerves of the upper left and lower left limbs were normal. A brain MRI on the 37th day after poisoning showed that the previous lesions in the cerebellar dentate nuclei region had subsided ().
With active physical therapy, the patient could walk straight on a wide base 2 months after poisoning. No dysmetria was noted on the finger-to-nose test, but heel or toe gait was impaired. The muscle power was grade 3/5 in the flexor and extensor of the right foot; 4/5 in the flexor and extensor of the left foot, and others were all 5/5. Weakness in the flexor and extensor of both feet still remained. A repeat EEG was normal. A repeat NCV study revealed no change in polyneuropathy with motor predominant axonal degeneration. The patient receives regular outpatient followups. He still walks with a clumsy gait and has difficulty with hand-grasping activity."
167,890409,848239,625699,"A 50-year-old woman was admitted to a county hospital in the suburb of Shanghai in August 2003 with acute colonic obstruction due to cancer of the sigmoid colon confirmed by colonoscopy. She underwent an emergency surgical resection of the tumor followed by end sigmoid colostomy and closure of the rectal stump at 10 cm above the anal verge (Hartmann procedure). The pathology was reported as well differentiated adenocarcinoma of the sigmoid without lymph node metastasis. Her postoperative course was uneventful. Asking for a restorative surgery four months later she was readmitted to the same hospital and operated by the same surgeon. There was no much adhesion in the pelvis and an end-to-end anastomosis was made using a circular stapler (Proximate® 29 mm, Ethicon). She was discharged from the hospital after three weeks. After her return to home she noticed passage of gas and later feces from vagina. She visited the surgeon's clinic again and had a check-up by the gynecologist. The gynecologist did not find her cervix uteri but a defect was found on her posterior vaginal wall five centimeter above the vaginal orifice with feces coming out. The surgeon denied any possibility of removal of her uterus during the surgery. At that point no treatment for rectovaginal fistula was given to the patient. Her case was presented to the medical malpractice committee for evaluation and she came to us to seek further treatment five months after her second operation.
Digital examination of the rectum revealed a 1.5 cm defect on the anterior anal wall 5 centimeters above the anal verge. Vaginal inspection showed three metal clips stapled both the anterior and posterior vaginal wall with small cleavages between the clips. Stool discharged from the vagina. The cervix uteri was not found. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed that the uterus was present closed to the sacrum. Before this admission she had had a colonoscopy undertaken in a university hospital in Shanghai which reported that the whole colon and the anastomotic site were otherwise normal but a fistula on the anterior rectal wall. The diagnosis of rectovaginal fistula was established and she was operated under epidural anesthesia. Transvaginal repair of rectovaginal fistula was performed. The patient was uneventful until the sixth postoperative day when she passed flatus and stool per vagina but not the rectum. Failure of repair was highly suspected and she was taken into the operation room and had an examination under anesthesia. A blind rectal remnant was found about ten centimeters above the anal orifice and the repaired rectovaginal fistula was all right. Vaginal examination found that after removal of the residual metal clips there was an opening at the anterior fornix of vagina which was three centimeters above the original rectovaginal fistula. The diagnosis of an inadvertent colovaginal anastomosis was established then and a laparotomy was undertaken. After dissection of dense adhesion in the low abdominal cavity and pelvis the uterus was found to be adhered to the sacropromotory and the sigmoid colon was located anteriorly across the left appendix uteri and ended in the anterior cul-de-sac. There was dense adhesion in this area indicating that there has been dissected during the previous surgery. The colovaginal anastomosis was identified by insertion of finger within the vagina. After detachment of the colovaginal anastomosis and repair of the anterior wall of vagina the sigmoid colon was anastomosed to the rectal remnant by a circular stapler (Proximate® 29 mm, Ethicon). Postoperative period was uneventful and the patient was discharged from the hospital eight days after the final operation. She was followed up nine months later with satisfactory result."
168,890409,899720,631424,"A 50 years old woman was admitted to the emergency department because of acute pain, coldness, and anesthesia in the left foot. Pulses at the left popliteal, tibialis posterior and at the dorsalis pedis artery were not palpable. For cardiovascular and prothrombotic risk factors, she had a 25 years history of cigarette smoking (30–35 cigarettes/day), a history of 16 months of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) by oral intake of an estrogen-gestagen combination (Presomen, 0.6 mg/d for 16 months) and untreated hypercholesterolemia (5.90 mmol/L, reference: <5.2 mmol/L). She had no previous medical history of arrhythmia, ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, or stroke. Duplex sonographic examination of the arterial system of the limbs revealed the acute thromboembolic occlusion of the left popliteal artery. Diagnostic work up was initiated to determine the source of the embolism. The resting ECG and a holter monitoring for 24 h disclosed normal sinus rhythm without any pathologic findings. The transthoracic echocardiographic examination (TTE) showed no structural or functional cardiac abnormalities. Subsequently, a TEE was performed for evaluation of the cardiac cavities and of the thoracic aorta, revealing a large, pedunculated and hypermobile thrombus (Figure , Panl A and B) attached to a non-atherosclerotic aortic wall caudal of the left subclavian artery. CT scans of the thoraco-abdominal aorta (Figure ) confirmed the presence of the thrombus seen in TEE. The entire thoracic aorta had normal dimensions with no visible signs of atherosclerosis. For biochemical laboratory parameters, thrombocytes (530*109/L, reference: <410*109/L), fibrinogen (5.5 g/L, normal: <3.50 g/L) and total Cholesterol (5.90 mmol/L, reference: <5.2 mmol/L) were elevated. All other parameters including glucose (5.8 mmol/L) and homocysteine (8.6 μmol/L) levels were within the reference limit. An extensive serologic survey for hypercoagulability, including antiphospholipid antibodies, and vasculitis disorders was negative.
Because of the high risk for recurrent peripheral embolization due to the size and the hypermobility of the thrombus, the patient was admitted to the vascular surgery unit, where a 15 cm long thrombus in the thoracic aorta with its origin 5 cm distal of the left subclavian artery could be removed. During surgery no macroscopical signs of intimal lesions of the aorta could be detected. Histological evaluation of the thrombus revealed a red, parietal thrombus without any evidence of malignancy. The postoperative course was uneventfull and the patient was discharged 10 days after the surgical intervention. The patient was treated with vitamin-k-antagonist phenprocoumon (INR: 2.5–3.5) for secondary prevention of thromboembolism and with 10 mg/d of atorvastatin for hypercholesterolemia additional to cessation of smoking and oral intake of HRT. On this therapeutic regimen, the patient was asymptomatic with no pathologic findings in the imaging workup at six months follow up."
169,895414,615655,753602,"A 47 year-old male patient presented to the dermatologist October 1998 following an episode of severe flare up of psoriasis, which he had had for 15 years. His condition improved with coal tar, hydrocortisone ointment and UVB. However, after stopping UVB, his flare up recurred. Methotrexate was introduced to his treatment regime. After a satisfactory baseline blood test and a trial dose of 2.5 mg, he started methotrexate (10 mg/week) in April 1999. Two weeks later the dose was increased to 15 mg/week. In June 1999, the dose was increased to 17.5 mg/week and then back to 15 mg/week in July 1999 with improvement of his psoriasis. There was no history of excess alcohol ingestion.
He had his first liver biopsy, six months later (October 1999) which showed moderate acinar zone 3 and 2 macrovesicular steatosis, with lesser amounts of microvesicular steatosis. Acinar zone 1, grade 1 parenchymal iron accumulation, with an acinar gradient, suggestive of heterozygous form of GH was seen with Perl's Prussian Blue (figure ); iron was not detected in sinusoidal Kupffer cells or macrophages. There was no evidence of fibrosis or, accumulation of copper or alpha 1 anti-trypsin. Genotypic studies confirmed heterozygosity for the HFE gene mutation H63D (in the absence of C282Y).
He had his second liver biopsy in November 2001; total cumulative methotrexate dose of 1.56 gm from his first liver biopsy. The biopsy showed moderate macrovesicular steatosis, mild steatohepatitis, grade 1 iron accumulation similar to his first biopsy but no fibrosis or contra-indication to the continued use of methotrexate."
170,895414,534184,881342,"A 52-year-old male with muscle invasive TCC (grade III) had undergone radical cystectomy and ileal orthotopic pouch reconstruction. Anastomosis of small intestine was performed in two layers (first runing chromic and second with simple separate silk sutures). On the 10th day after the operation while the patient was on normal diet and had no abdominal symptom or defecation disorder, fecaloid materials were found in urine and drained secretions. Enteropouch and entrocutaneous fistulae were confirmed using oral activated charcoal. The patient was put on fasting and TPN. Antibiotic therapy was initiated, consequently, urinary fecaloid drainage and enterocutoneous fistula improved. However enteropouch fistula remained unresolved even after one month of conservative management. The patient was discharged with free urinary drainage and low residue diet for another month, but the fistula persisted. Upper GI series revealed no pertinent information (fig. ), but pouchogram (fig. ) revealed that the fistula was proximal to the ileocecal junction and most probably on the bowel anastomosis.
Performing surgery, via previous surgical scar (lower midline) all adhesion bands were released and anastomosis (defined by silk sutures) was separated from the pouch, but no fistula was revealed. Thus, with intestine clamped on each side of anastomosis and saline was injected to the lumen, intraluminal pressure increased gradually and fistula appeared by leaking fluid through it.
Fistula repair was done in two layers (after freshing of its edges) in transverse fashion to decrease the risk of stricture. Omentum was interposed between the pouch and fistula without tension. The patient was on TPN and NPO for 5 days and free drainage for two weeks. After two weeks pouchogram was performed and no fistula was seen subsequently the patient was discharged with clean intermittent catheterization. Follow-up up to one year was indicative of favourable outcome."
171,896478,519085,787205,"A 64-year old woman was admitted to the Gastroenterology Unit of another Hospital for abdominal pain, nausea, weight loss, and recurrent episodes of constipation. She had suffered from intermittent pain located in the right lower quadrant for 2 years, but denied chronic diarrhea. She was diagnosed as having Crohn's disease of the terminal ileum by ileocolonoscopy and histology. An upper gastrointestinal series excluded CD in the upper gastrointestinal tract.
After inductive therapy with azathioprine and corticosteroids, the patient was maintained with mesalazine 500 mg × 4 daily. Prednisone 50 mg/day was added only during acute phases; in the six years following the discharge, 2 episodes of abdominal pain and dyarrhea requiring steroid therapy were recorded. Seven years later the patient was admitted to our Institution for abdominal pain, nausea, iron deficiency anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and intestinal obstruction. On physical examination no masses in the abdomen were noted. Small bowel double-contrast enteroclysis (Fig. ) showed a stricture of the terminal ileum with a thickening of the wall without extravasation of the contrast material. CT scan performed by using intravenous and oral contrast material revealed thickening of the terminal ileum with stranding of the mesenteric fat. There was no clinical evidence of carcinoid tumor so biochemical tests for carcinoid syndrome were not carried out.
At operation, there was a stricturing lesion in the last 6 cm of the terminal ileum with proximal dilation. The wall of the affected ileal loop and caecum was thick and fibrous. Resection of the terminal ileum and caecum was performed. The intestinal continuity was obtained with an end-to-end ileocolic hand-sewn anastomosis.
The surgical specimen included 28 cm of the terminal ileum and caecum. Grossly, all the length of surgical resection showed diffuse thickness of the intestinal wall. There was no evidence of malignancy (Fig. ). Histologically, all resected surgical specimen was characterized by deep ulcers, marked proliferation of small lymph nodules involving all layers of the intestinal wall, sometimes with sarcoid-type granulomas and serosal inflammation. Moreover, two malignancies growing together were found in the ileal loop. The first showed glandular differentiation of large cells with round to oval nuclei sometimes with large nucleoli and abundant pale cytoplasm infiltrating the entire wall (pT2N0M0). The latter consisted of quite uniform medium size cells with round nuclei and inconspicuous nucleoli growing in a trabecular or acinar pattern (Fig. ). Only the immunohistochemistry of this latter tumoral population showed strong and diffuse immunoreactivity to neuroendocrine markers such as Chromogranin A and Synaptophisin. All excised mesenteric lymph nodes were negative for malignant cells. The postoperative recovery was uneventful and the patient was discharged in general good condition. At 18-months follow-up the patient, checked by colonoscopy and ileoscopy was well, free from malignancy relapse or recurrence of CD, and with normal 24-hour urinary excretion of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)."
172,896478,514232,959416,"A 34-year-old Caucasian non smoking woman was referred to our Sterility Center. Her personal anamnesis revealed three early pregnancy loss within 8 and 12 week of gestation and one extrauterine pregnancy. The patient did not revealed previous thromboembolic disease (arterial or venous) nor haemorragic disorders; moreover patient was not ongoing any type of pharmacological treatment. A thorough familial anamnesis did not show a trend toward thromboembolic and/or haemorragic disease.
To understand pathophysiology of her RPL the patient performed several laboratory and instrumental tests.
A normal ovarian function and ovulation were detected by normal values of Follicle-stimulating Hormone, Luteinising Hormone, oestradiol and progesterone and by ovarian ultrasound scan (data not shown). Uterine and salpinxes malformation was excluded by hysterosalpingography and hysteroscopy (data not shown). Endocrinological diseases such as diabetes and dysthyroidism were evaluated and excluded by normal values of glycaemia, thriiodothyronine (i.e. FT3), thyroxine (i.e. FT4) and Thyroid-stimulating Hormone (data not shown). Inflammatory chronic diseases were excluded by normal values of erythro-sedimentation rate and acute phase C reactive protein and immunopathological chronic disease, such as erytematosus systemic lupus, by normal level of antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anitmithocondrial antibodies (AMA) and smooth muscle antibodies (SMA) too (data not shown); moreover patient did not suffer of chronic joint paint or fever or other related symptoms.
Yet, routine haemostatic tests showed normal value of prothrombin time, measured as International Normalised Ratio (PT INR, 1.15) and a prolonged activated thromboplastin time, measured as ratio (aPTT, 1.45) (table ). To confirm this laboratory alteration, after 15 days a second step of haemostatic parameters were tested and confirmed normal value of PT INR and prolonged aPTT (1.46, table and ), associated to normal levels of anticardiolipin antibodies (tested by an ELISA method; IgM 1.7 U/MPL and IgG 3.9 U/GPL) (table and ), fibrinogen and clotting factors V, VIII, IX, X, XI (table1), while a reduced plasmatic level of clotting factor XII was detected (65%, table and ). So, we tested for aPTT and factor XII first degree relatives (i.e. one sister and parents) but did not find alterations (data not shown). Yet, lupus anticoagulant and antibodies to β-2-glycoprotein I were absent (table and ). Furthermore, because RPL was associated to reduced clotting inhibitors also protein C, protein S and antithrombin III were analysed and resulted in normal range (table ) such as inherited thrombophilia associated to Factor V Leiden and prothrombin A20210G gene polymorphisms (table ). Moreover, to confirm factor XII deficiency, after one month the patient was evaluated again and results showed again prolonged aPTT (1.48), reduced factor XII (55%). So, we tested aPTT adding to the plasma patient's a normal plasma sample with a ratio of plasma patient's to pool plasma 1/1 v/v; results revealed a partial correction of aPTT (1.30) suggesting a possible presence of an acquired clotting inhibitor and/or antiphospholipid antibodies. A new evaluation of common antiphospholipid antibodies began with normal levels of anticardiolipin antibodies (tested again with an ELISA method; IgM 1.5 and IgG 3.8) and absence of antibodies to β-2-Glycoprotein I, but a positivity for lupus anticoagulant was detected (table ). Lupus anticoagulant was assayed according to recommendations of the International Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis. Furthermore, at this time we tested again ANA that resulted again negative. Finally, because a transient positivity of lupus anticoagulant has been associated with factor XII deficiency in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome in rare cases [,], after one month the patient was evaluated one more time and in this time also antibodies to clotting factor XII were evaluated by an ELISA method. Results showed prolonged aPTT (1.44), reduced factor XII plasma levels (43%), normal range of anticardiolipin antibodies (IgM and IgG), absence of antibodies to β-2-Glycoprotein I, negativity for lupus anticoagulant, while antibodies to factor XII have been detected (table ). So, according to our data and data available in the Literature the patient was diagnosed an unusual form of primary antiphospholipid syndrome and an antithrombotic treatment was suggested."
173,912126,692219,640007,"A 47 year old lady presented to the emergency department with a four hour history of severe central chest pain radiating to the neck. She had a significant psychiatric history with multiple episodes of self harm and had previously been hospitalised with behavioural problems. The patient had a history of multiple admissions with cardiac sounding chest pain, all with normal ECG and cardiac troponin levels. An outpatient stress nuclear perfusion scan was normal. The patient also had a history of arterial hypertension and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and was managed on a combination of amitriptyline, losartan, amlodipine and flecainide. During this admission she repeatedly denied taking an overdose.
On admission to the emergency room the patient was unresponsive with a GCS of 6. She rapidly regained consciousness but remained slightly drowsy. Pupil response was normal. Her pulse was 70 bpm and blood pressure 60/40 mmHg. The 12-lead ECG (figure ) revealed atrial fibrillation with a broad QRS complex (320 ms) with a sine wave appearance. An ECG had been performed 4 weeks previously and was normal. She had normal serum potassium (4.1 mmol/l). The presentation with chest pain led to a presumptive diagnosis of an acute myocardial infarction and she was treated with thrombolysis with intravenous alteplase. Ten minutes later there was a significant change in her ECG (figure ). Inotropic support was instituted with dobutamine and subsequently with adrenaline to maintain her blood pressure. She remained hypotensive with poor urine output and was transferred to the regional cardiothoracic unit for further management. Blood was taken for paracetamol, salicylate levels which were normal. Flecanide levels were requested. Blood gases showed pH 7.37, pCO2 6.1kPa, pO2 11.7, bicarbonate 25.3 mmol/l
On arrival at our institution, transthoracic echocardiography revealed global moderate impairment of left ventricular function. Emergency coronary angiography was performed demonstrating normal epicardial coronary arteries and left ventriculography confirmed the echocardiography findings. An intra-aortic balloon pump was inserted with a rapid improvement in haemodynamics. Over the following 48 hours the patient was weaned from the inotropes and the intra-aortic balloon pump was removed. During this period her QRS duration gradually returned to normal (figure ) with left axis deviation and first degree heart block (which was present 12 months previously). Repeat echocardiography demonstrated normal left ventricular function.
Following discharge her flecanide levels were returned as 2340 μg/l (normal therapeutic range 200–700 μg/l) at 24 hours post admission."
174,912126,349434,635201,"A 74-year-old female with no significant past medical history presented with complaints of headache in conjunction with speech and memory problems for approximately one month. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an enhancing cystic lesion in the left temporal lobe. A partial resection of the left temporal mass, revealed a malignant neoplasm on frozen section and on final pathological evaluation, a diagnosis of GBM was made. Immunohistochemical results showed positive staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and no evidence of positive staining for cytokeratin. The patient received adjuvant external beam radiation therapy.
Approximately nine months later the patient returned with both speech and short-term memory problems. MRI revealed tumor recurrence in the left temporal area. Stereotactic biopsy demonstrated a necrotic tumor consistent with GBM on frozen section, a diagnosis confirmed on permanent sections. The stereotactic biopsy was followed by intraoperative injection of the chemotherapeutic agent DTI-015 []. Three months later, the patient returned with a 2.0 cm subcutaneous mass in the left parietal scalp, approximately six centimeters from the closest postoperative scar. Fine needle aspiration biopsy of the left parietal scalp mass revealed a GBM. The lesion was excised a month later with histological confirmation of the diagnosis. Following excision of the scalp mass, a repeat MRI documented progression of the primary tumor. The patient died of pulmonary embolism one month after excision of the scalp mass.
FNA biopsy of the palpable left parietal subcutaneous scalp mass was performed by a pathologist, using a 23 gauge needle. Four smears and one cell block were prepared. The air dried smears were stained with a modified Wright stain (Diff-Quik®); the 95% ethanol fixed smears were stained with the Papanicolaou stain.
The smears were abundantly cellular with atypical cells arranged in loosely cohesive clusters, ranging from 5 to 40 cells per cluster, with overlapping nuclei (Fig. ). Scattered atypical mitoses were also present (Fig. ). Morphologically, the cells were polygonal to spindle-shaped with increased nuclear to cytoplasmic ratios, moderate nuclear pleomorphism, coarsely clumped hyperchromatic chromatin, irregular nuclear membranes, and distinct nucleoli. Binucleated and multinucleated cells were also noted. A few scattered intranuclear inclusions were present (Fig. ). Fibrillary processes extending from the atypical cells were apparent. A tumor diathesis consisting of neutrophils, degenerated cells, necrotic debris, a few lymphocytes, and bare nuclei made up the background. The cell block showed similar findings as well as characteristic necrotic foci surrounded by palisading spindle-shaped atypical cells (geographic necrosis) (Fig. ). Immunohistochemically, the atypical cells displayed strong reactivity for GFAP (Fig. ) and vimentin with no reactivity for CD45, cytokeratin, and HMB-45, supporting the diagnosis of GBM. The histological sections from the tumor excised a month later verified the FNA findings of GBM (Fig. )."
175,912417,627974,545764,"A 63-year-old man presented to a regional hospital on September 8, 2003 with a 2-week history of diffuse abdominal pain and mild diarrhea, without fever. In 1988, he had received a Dacron aorto-bifemoral graft for an infra-renal aortic aneurysm. A computerized tomography (CT) of the abdomen revealed a para-prosthetic fluid collection. Blood cultures were sterile in the absence of any recent antibiotic therapy. Laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 5.8 G/l, a CRP of 48 mg/l, no increase of liver enzymes and a normal serum creatinine level. Empirical ciprofloxacin and metronidazole therapy was initiated and abdominal pain improved.
After two months of antibiotic therapy, the patient was admitted to the University Hospital in Lausanne for removal of the vascular prosthesis because of presumed persistent infection, despite two months of antibiotic treatment. On admission, the patient was afebrile. Clinical examination was normal except for mild periumbilical tenderness on deep palpation. Laboratory results showed a normal WBC count (4.9 G/l), a normal CRP (<2 mg/l), and normal renal and liver functions. At laparotomy, extensive adhesions and a right para-iliac purulent mass were found. The prosthetic graft was partially removed, and replaced by a homograft. Multiple intra-operative specimens did not grow any microorganisms in culture. Histopathology showed a chronic inflammatory infiltrate, ill-formed non-necrotizing granulomas, and degenerative changes such as calcifications and fibrosis (Figure &). No microorganisms could be identified using Periodic acid-Schiff, Gram, Grocott methenamine silver and Giemsa stains.
16S rRNA PCR amplification plus sequencing performed on a fragment of the para-iliac mass was positive for Coxiella burnetii, using the BAK11w forward and the PC3mod reverse primers []. The diagnosis of C. burnetii chronic infection was confirmed by a positive serology performed at Unité des Rickettsies, Marseille, France: phase I antibody titer (IgG): 1600, phase II antibody titer (IgG): 3200. Antibiotic therapy with doxycycline (100 mg bid orally) and chloroquine (200 mg tid orally) was started. The dose of doxycycline was increased to 300 mg daily to reach a concentration of at least 5 μg/mL []. Eighteen months later (May 2005), the patient was asymptomatic and serology showed persistence of high levels of phase I IgG (1600) and phase II IgG (3200).
C. burnetii is a strict intracellular bacterium. It is the causative agent of Q fever, a worldwide zoonosis mainly transmitted by inhalation of infected particles. There is a wide animal reservoir, and sheep and cattle are probably the main source of human infections. Our patient had no environmental exposure to C. burnetii. Chronic Q fever is mainly seen in patients with underlying risk factors such as valvulopathy, pregnancy, and immunosuppression. Endocarditis accounts for 73% of chronic Q fever cases, followed by vascular infection (8%), including infections of aneurysms and vascular grafts [,]. Given the significant morbidity and mortality of vascular infection, and given the importance of targeted and prolonged antibiotic therapy, the diagnosis of C. burnetii infection is crucial to a successful therapeutic outcome. We report here a rare case of C. burnetii vascular graft infection. This unexpected diagnosis was based on broad-range PCR. Q fever is probably underdiagnosed since the diagnosis will be missed if it is not systematically looked for in patients with vascular graft infections of unknown etiology.
The diagnosis of Q fever is most frequently made by serology. C. burnetii presents a variation of phase (phases I and II). Antiphase I IgG at titers of ≥1:800 by microimmunofluorescence are indicative of chronic Q fever [,]. The diagnosis has also be made using molecular methods including 16S rRNA PCR amplification plus sequencing or a specific C. burnetii PCR. To shorten the diagnostic delay, Fenollar et al. developed a nested-PCR assay with serum as a template which showed a sensitivity of 64% and a specificity of 100% []. In the present case, 16s rRNA PCR amplification plus sequencing was critical for diagnosis, since Q fever had not been suspected clinically. Broad-range PCR was also recently shown to be useful for the diagnosis of blood culture-negative infectious endocarditis, identifying an etiological agent in 35.5% of cases (11/31), including 3 cases due to C. burnetii []. The histology of Q fever endocarditis is non-specific and is characterized by fibrosis and calcifications, mild inflammation, and small or absent vegetations. Brouqui et al. observed a granulomatous inflammation in one third of cases with Q fever endocarditis, but well formed granuloma were not identified. In these cases, degenerative changes such as valvular calcifications or foreign body reaction prevented the establishment of a specific association between C. burnetii infection and granulomatous inflammation []. The presence of foamy macrophages, also observed in our case, may suggest a Coxiella infection. Definite histological diagnosis relies upon immunohistology, that may demonstrate the presence of C. burnetii within the cytoplasm of macrophages []. However, this diagnostic method is less sensitive than PCR []. Thus, immunohistology is unlikely to be a useful tool for the diagnosis of C. burnetii vascular graft infection. Cell culture is not widely available as a diagnostic technique as it requires trained technicians and a biosafety level 3 laboratory.
Tetracyclines are the antibiotics of choice for acute Q fever []. The bactericidal activity of doxycycline is maximal at pH 6.6. However, the Coxiella-containing vacuole is acidic. Therefore, addition of chloroquine that acts as an alkalinizing agent of the vacuole is essential to improve the efficacy of doxycycline therapy []. Combination of doxycycline and hydroxychloroquine for at least 18 months is the recommended therapy for Q fever endocarditis []. This combined treatment is probably also indicated in case of C. burnetii vascular graft infection. Since serum doxycycline concentration is correlated with decrease in levels of phase I antibodies, it is recommended to adjust the dosage of doxycycline []. Patients are considered cured when phase I IgG antibodies decrease below 1:800, and IgA and IgM antibodies below 1:50 []. In this case, after 18 months of therapy, antiphase I serology remains strongly positive suggesting persistent infection most likely due to the fact that the infected prosthesis could only be partially removed. It also shows how difficult it is to eradicate C. burnetii and emphasizes the need for prolonged antibiotic treatment course. Serological follow-up will guide our decision regarding the treatment duration."
176,912417,687262,417231,"A 54 year old man presented with a lump in the right axilla of six months duration. The lump was non tender and had not changed in size. He complained of weight loss of 5 kg over the past two months. He denied foreign travel, night sweats, recent injury, cough, or the presence of any other lumps. His past medical history was unremarkable. There was no family history of breast or bowel cancer. The lump was clinically palpable and measured 3 cm. It was firm, non tender, not attached to the skin or deep tissues and was consistent with a clinical diagnosis of axillary lymphadenopathy. The left axilla and supraclavicular fossae were normal. There was no skin lesion in the drainage area of the axilla. Examination of the breasts, chest and abdomen were unremarkable. Haematology, Biochemistry and Chest X-rays were normal. Ultrasound confirmed a benign appearing lymph node with a fatty centre. In view of the size and longstanding nature of the lymph node, an excision biopsy was performed. At surgery the node was firm, suspicious and black in colour.
On histology, the specimen of the lymph node with attached fatty tissue measured 3 × 2 × 0.8 cms. Black discolouration was present on the cut surface.
Microscopic examination of the routine haematoxylin and eosin sections of the lymph node showed preservation of architecture with follicular hyperplasia. Black carbon like pigment was seen lying within the macrophages and dispersed outside them in the sinuses. There was associated fibrosis. Multiple sections did not reveal any evidence of metastatic malignant melanoma.
Immunohistochemical staining for S 100 protein and histochemical stain (Masson's Fontana) was done to further exclude that possibility.
Retrospectively we noted the 30-year old tattoo that the patient had on his right arm."
177,917816,518277,115509,"A 60-year-old woman was diagnosed to have a left breast cancer stage T2 N1 M0 hormone receptor-positive in 1997. She was treated with modified radical mastectomy, adjuvant chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, adriamycin and 5-fluorouracil, followed by adjuvant hormonal therapy. She completed five years of adjuvant tamoxifen in 2003 and and was started on letrozole adjuvant therapy in January 2004 [].
The patient had an ocular history significant for bilateral dacryocystitis, cataracts and open angle glaucoma, left dacryocystectomy (DCR) in 1997, right DCR in 2000 and 2003, as well as a right eye phacoemulsification with implantation of a hydrophilic acrylic intraocular lens in 2003 with a postoperative uncorrected visual acuity of 20/25. The patient was maintained on antiglaucoma treatment in the form of topical beta blocker eyedrops for both eyes, combined with prostaglandin eyedrops for her left eye.
The patient was scheduled to have zoledronic acid 4 mg once every six months for osteoporosis. In August 2004, the patient was given intravenous hydration with normal saline, premedicated with paracetamol, and had an intravenous infusion of zoledronic acid 4 mg in 100 cc normal saline given over 30 minutes. The patient did well throughout the infusion; however, she felt chilly and feverish overnight. The next day, she presented to the Emergency Department complaining of severe right eye pain and decreased vision. Examination revealed uncorrected visual acuity of 20/100 in the right eye and 20/60 in the left eye. The intraocular pressure was 14 mmHg in both eyes. Slit lamp examination revealed marked ciliary injection of the right eye, and a 2+ flare and inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber. An inflammatory fibrinous pupillary membrane was also present (Fig ). Fundus examination was normal. A diagnosis of right anterior uveitis was made. The patient was placed on topical prednisone every 6 hours, and atropine eyedrops every 12 hours. She responded well to the treatment which was gradually tapered off over a period of 6 weeks without recurrence of uveitis. Following treatment, visual acuity in the right eye improved to 20/30, and slit lamp examination revealed slight opacification of the posterior capsule (Fig ), and residual pigmented deposits on the surface of the intraocular lens (Fig ). These inflammatory changes and deposits on the posterior lens surface disappeared on their own over a period of 3 months, but residual posterior capsular opacification (PCO) is still present. This PCO has no effect on the patient's visual acuity at present and doesn't require any intervention.
Unlike in metastatic bone diseases where bisphosphonate therapy is administered on a monthly basis, our plan was to give the patient zoledronic acid every six months []. The patient refused to have any further bisphosphonate therapy"
178,917816,451664,120597,"A 63-year-old Brazilian woman was referred to the hospital with a 20-year history of an increasing size of the anterior portion of the neck associated with progressive exertional dyspnea, nighttime snoring and coughing, dysphagia of solids and daytime sleepiness. She had no history of hypertension, cigarette smoking, alcohol ingestion, weight loss, fractures or fever. Her medical history was significant for intermittent claudication.
Physical examination showed a thin woman (body mass index of 17 kg/m2) with a hard, irregular, painless, mobile tumoration on the anterior surface of the neck. No lymph nodes were palpable and hoarseness was evident. There was no craniofacial abnormality. The results of oral cavity, thyroid, cardiopulmonary and abdominal examination were unremarkable. The femoral arteries appeared to be thickened and pulses were frail although there were no signs of acute limb ischemia.
Pelvic and lower extremity roentgenograms showed dense, ""rail tracking"" femoral artery calcification associated with near-total obstruction of these vessels confirmed by translumbar aortography (figure ). A neck X-ray and computed tomography evidenced grossly calcified areas of soft tissue in the topography of the pharynx and larynx. Direct laryngoscopy confirmed exophytic calcic deposits in the left pyriform sinus (figure and ). No other images of abnormal calcifications were found at any other sites, such as the arms, lung, heart, aorta or abdomen. A bone scintigram showed increased uptake of 99 mTc-methylene diphosphate in the calcified femoral arteries and on the anterior surface of the neck (figure ). Right hip and lumbar spine bone densitometry evidenced supportive findings of osteoporosis. Chest X-ray revealed mild enlargement of cardiac area associated with ectasic thoracic aorta; pulmonary aspects were normal. Doppler echocardiography revealed mild pulmonary hypertension (39 mmHg) associated with mild left atrium and moderate left ventricle enlargement; there was a diffuse left ventricle hypokinesia associated with an ejection fraction of 32% (indirectly measured by echocardiography). Also, there was an eccentrical left ventricular hypertrophy, severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. There was no abnormality in the right ventricle. Cineangiocoronariography was attempted to directly analyse any coronary disease as a possible cause of these abnormalities, but the rigidity of femoral and brachial arteries impeded the insertion of the catheter.
Sleep variables obtained from polysomnography were indicative of severe OSA (table ) with an apnea/hypopnea index of 51.6 per hour (40.9 apnea episodes/h), 89% of which occurred together with bradycardia and extra beats. Minimal oxygen saturation was 88%. The spirometric study demonstrated mild obstructive airway disease with no responsiveness after bronchodilator test. Also, there was a moderate decrease in the pulmonary diffusion capacity (Collins GS Plus Modular System, Warren E Collins Inc. Braintree, MA).
Except for the impaired fasting glucose state (fasting blood glucose of 117 mg/dl), there were no other biochemical abnormalities concerning calcium, phosphate, magnesium, creatinine and parathyroid hormone. Clinical and laboratory findings excluded any kind of rheumatologic disease such as dermatomyositis, scleroderma or systemic lupus erythematosus. Biopsy specimens from the pharynx and temporal artery revealed soft tissue calcification and medial artery calcinosis, respectively (Figure ).
Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) tritation for treatment of such obstructive sleep apnea has been tried twice on different occasions, but the patient has complained of extreme discomfort (she could hardly sleep during the procedures). A pressure of 10 cm H2O was reached during some short periods of sleep with a very low effect on the frequency of episodes of apnea. So, with the aim of stopping further vascular and soft tissue calcification, intravenous dissodic pamidronate was administred (60 mg IV diluted in 250 mL of saline solution once a day for 1 day)."
179,925841,583271,902256,"A previously healthy 69-year old man presented with a 5-day history of severe pain over the right forehead and a 3-day history of vesicular eruption over right forehead, right eyelid, and nose. It was followed by the spread of vesicular eruption to involve chest, back and bilateral upper and lower extremities over next 2-days. Review of systems was negative. The patient did not have a history of chickenpox during childhood or any recent exposure to it. There was no past history of diabetes, cardiac or pulmonary disease, or lymphoma. The patient has not been on immunosuppressive or other medications.
On examination, the patient was afebrile (37.4°C). He had vesicles and pustules, with crusting and swelling, in the distribution of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve (V1) including its nasociliary branch. Both eyelids were swollen, tender and red. There was no corneal involvement. Vesicles, pustules and scabs in various stages were also present over trunk and extremities (Figure ). Palms and soles were spared and there was no lymphadenopathy. Pulmonary, cardiovascular and abdominal examinations were normal.
Complete blood count, peripheral smear, routine biochemistry, liver function tests, and chest x-ray were normal. CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte counts were 1.34 × 109/L and 0.61 × 109/L respectively (CD4:CD8 ratio = 2.2). Serology for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C were negative and RPR was non-reactive. The blood and vesicle culture for Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) were negative. Serum VZV Immunoglobulin G (IgG) and Immunoglobulin M (IgM) done six days after the onset of dissemination were positive (the titers were not obtained). Skin biopsy from fresh vesicle on the trunk and forearm showed ulceration with acute inflammation, necrosis and intranuclear inclusions within epithelial cells. The direct fluorescence antigen staining from skin lesions was positive for VZV.
The patient was started on intravenous Acyclovir 800 mg every 8 hours. In the next 24 hours, the eruption of new vesicles ceased, the rash started to resolve and his clinical status improved. I.V. Acyclovir was continued for four more days and the patient discharged on oral acyclovir 800 mg 5 times daily for 16 days."
180,925841,926835,760348,"A healthy looking 29 year old Nigerian male presented at the dental outpatient clinic of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital for the purpose of a dental check-up. It was his first visit to the dentist. He did not present any significant medical history. Oral examination showed a fair oral hygiene, no carious lesion, and all the permanent teeth were present. The mandibular left central incisor was displaced lingually with an accessory cusp on the facial aspect which had an attrition facet on the incisal edge. The cusp projected from the cemento – enamel junction and curved towards the incisal edge of the incisor (Figure ). There was also attrition of the incisal half of the palatal aspect of the maxillary left central incisor. There was a negative family history of such dental anomaly from the patient and there was no associated systemic disorder. A periapical radiograph revealed an inverted V-shaped radiopaque structure on the mandibular left central incisor (Figure ). The extent of pulp tissue into the cusp could not be determined on the radiograph. A diagnosis of type 1 talon cusp was made. The condition and the planned periodic and gradual reduction of the cusp with topical fluoride application and Composite resin facing was explained to the patient. Orthodontic alignment of the displaced central incisor was also planned. With his consent, after oral prophylaxis, a minimal reduction of the talon cusp was carried out using a diamond bur in a high-speed water-cooled handpiece. Acidulated Phosphate Fluoride (APF) gel was applied to the surface of the reduced cusp and the maxillary left central incisor. The patient however failed to turn up for further treatment. It was assumed that as the patient was not initially concerned with the aesthetic effect of the cusp, the outcome was not important to him."
181,926837,114284,223439,"This twenty-seven years old male presented with complaints of fever with rigor and chills and sore throat for ten days. It was associated with myalgia and recurrent vomiting followed by diffuse maculopapular rash all over the body with sparing of mucous membranes and periorbital tissues. On examination, he had conjunctival congestion with toxic facies. He had a past history of gout for which he received allolpurinol for twenty days and phenytoin for sudden loss of consciousness in another institution. There was no past history of tuberculosis, diabetes or hypertension.
Bilateral hard indurated cervical lymphadenopathy and bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy was also observed along with bilateral parotid and submandibular gland enlargement. Hepatosplenomegaly was detected on ultrasonography. Hemogram on several occasions from admission revealed normal hemoglobin and red blood cell morphology. There was transient neutrophilic leukocytosis, whereas platelet counts and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal throughout. During his treatment with ceftriaxone, he suddenly developed shock, cyanosis and acute renal failure for which he was given inotropic support, amoxicillin, ceftazidine and steroids. He gradually responded and recovered in due course of time. A clinical diagnosis of shock syndrome due to Dengue fever or Epstein Barr virus (EBV) or streptococcus or phenytoin induced hypersensitivity syndrome was made. The Dengue virus IgM antibody Elisa was positive and serum D-dimer levels were positive (>200 ng/ml). Anti EBV IgG antibody test was positive but EBV IgM antibody test was negative. The serology tests for anti- cytomegalovirus antibody, anti leptospira antibody, Widal test, brucella (abortus and melitensis), and HIV were negative. The blood, throat swab and urine cultures were sterile. Paul-Bunnel and Weil-Felix tests were negative. Cervical lymph node biopsy was undertaken for histopathology.
Gross examination revealed four lymph nodes, the largest one measuring 1.5 cm and the rest below 1 cm. On microscopy, two of the lymph nodes (including the largest one) showed near total infarction of the parenchyma with preservation of cellular outlines of the lymphocytes (Fig ). A thin rim of viable subcapsular normal mature lymphocytes along with neutrophils and plasma cells were identified. The medullary vessels showed vascular congestion however the blood vessels in the perinodal adipose tissue showed multiple fibrin thrombi with congestion in some of the vessels (Fig ).
Multiple deeper sections revealed perinodal granulation tissue with viable subcapsular lymphoid tissue but no atypical cells, histiocytes or granulomas were seen. Stains for fungi and acid-fast bacilli were negative. The adjacent two uninvolved lymph nodes showed features of reactive change. Immunohistochemistry with B- cell (CD20) and T- cell (CD3) markers was performed. The viable lymphoid tissue showed an admixture of both B and T-cells. The infarcted tissue showed variable positivity and these markers highlighted few reactive follicles (Fig ). The uninvolved lymph nodes also showed a normal positivity pattern.
The patient was asymptomatic thereafter and had complete regression of the lymph nodes. He was lost to follow up after two months of discharge from the hospital.
Lymph node infarction is a rare phenomenon reported in literature in association with various neoplastic and non-neoplastic conditions. The non-neoplastic conditions associated with infarction are namely polyarteritis nodosa, viral infections (Parvovirus B19, Infectious mononucleosis), cholesterol atheromatous embolism, thrombosis, gold injections, intestinal volvulus, postmediastinoscopy, mononeuritis multiplex, fine needle aspiration cytology and finally may be idiopathic [-]. Hemorrhagic infarction of hilar lymph nodes has also been reported recently in association with heart lung transplantation. [,]
The neoplastic lesions most commonly associated with infarction are malignant lymphoma and metastatic melanoma [,-]. The differential diagnosis pertaining to the present case would be the above mentioned two conditions along with necrotizing lymphadenitis (Kikuchi's lymphadenitis), mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome, and necrotizing granulomatous inflammation.
Serial deeper sections failed to reveal any evidence of either lymphoma or melanoma, any granulomatous inflammation, and vasculitis or monocytoid histiocytes, thus ruling out the above mentioned conditions. Drug induced hypersensitivity reactions in a lymph node especially due to phenytoin are known in the form of inter follicular expansion by a mixed infiltrate of immunoblasts, plasma cells and eosinophils with varying degrees of vascular proliferation. Focal necrosis has also been observed. Other drugs have been reported to show reactive change []. These changes were not seen in the present case in the non-infarcted lymph nodes. In the present case it appears that infarction of the lymph node occurred before the DIC became clinically evident.
A completely infarcted lymph node should alert the pathologist to the high possibility of malignant lymphoma, as it is the most common cause of spontaneous lymph node infarction []. Further investigation can be carried out by taking multiple deeper sections of the infarcted lymph node to visualize the viable subcapsular tissue for any clue of malignancy. Immunohistochemistry has been done on the infarcted lymph node sections to establish the underlying pathology. Although it is widely believed that necrotic tissue is not suitable for immunohistochemical study, this view may be inaccurate. [-]
The detection of spontaneous lymph node infarction should alert the pathologist and the clinician alike for an associated or underlying impending pathology. In a multicentre study of 51 cases of lymph-node infarction seen in the 30-year period, Maurer et al identified 14 cases of malignant lymphoma synchronously with the infarct. Of the remaining 37 patients, six showed manifestations of malignant lymphoma in the follow-up period within 2 years of the lymph-node infarction.
On analyzing other cases in the literature these authors also confirmed that a minority (26 of 81) have developed malignant lymphoma, which appeared within 2 years of infarction. Therefore, a thorough examination of both the infarcted lymph nodes and others resected at the same time is mandatory in order to exclude concomitant or underlying malignant lymphoma. The risk of development of malignant lymphoma after infarction was found to be negligible after two years []."
182,926837,746247,964900,"We report on a 46-year-old female patient with histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the right lung. The patient underwent pneumonectomy and unilateral lymphadenectomy in December 2001. Because of histologically verified positive resection margins, it was decided to administer 4 cycles of a postoperative polychemotherapy regimen including cisplatin 25 mg/m2and etoposide 120 mg/m2 on day 1, day 2 and day 3 followed by chest irradiation. Due to a prescription error, the patient received 75 mg/m2 cisplatin per day, instead of 25 mg/m2 resulting in a total dose of 225 mg/m2 cisplatin within a 3-day period. The error was not noticed and the patient was discharged. Two days later, the patient presented with severe nausea and vomiting, loss of hearing, tinnitus and was unable to eat and drink. Due to the severity of these side effects, the medical records of the patient were reviewed and the cisplatin overdose was discovered. Supportive treatment including vigorous hydration, electrolyte replacement and antiemetic therapy was started immediately. Total platinum plasma levels which were determined daily showed highly elevated values (2.9 mg platinum per kg plasma). Therefore, plasmapheresis was performed on day 5 and 6 after the last administration of cisplatin to attempt to eliminate the drug. The platinum concentrations were measured by an Agilent 7500c inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany) equipped with a PFA50 microconcentric nebulizer. The plasma samples were mineralisated microwave assisted with a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid (1 ml sample + 2 ml of nitric acid + 0.5 ml of hydrochloric acid + 1.5 ml ultrapure water) in an UltraCLAVE2 (EMLS, Leutkirch, Germany) at 250°C for 30 minutes before measurement. Plasmapheresis was carried out via a catheter placed in the right femoral vein and using a plasma filtration technique with Hemaplex BT 900/A Filters (Dideco, Mirandola, Italy). During each treatment session, 3 liters of plasma were removed and continuously substituted with 1.5 liter of solvent-detergent treated standardized pooled human plasma (Octaplas, Octapharma Vienna, Austria) and 1.5 liter of 5% human albumin (Immuno, Vienna, Austria). Anticoagulation therapy during plasmapheresis consisted of 3000 IU (international units) heparin administered as intravenous bolus and 1000 IU heparin per hour as continuous infusion. The plasma levels of total platinum showed a marked decline after plasma exchange at first, followed by a small rise and then a constant decline afterwards as demonstrated in Figure . After the first plasmapheresis, hearing loss and tinnitus improved gradually as well as renal failure. (The elevated laboratory findings are shown in Table.) Severe myelosuppression required the administration of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, two units of packed and irradiated erythrocytes as well as two units of packed, pooled and irradiated thrombocytes. In order to manage prolonged severe nausea and vomiting which lasted for 12 days, a complex antiemetic regimen including 5HT3-antagonists, dexamethasone, metoclopramide and neuroleptics was given. Finally, we were able to discharge the patient 18 days after onset of the overdose. She recovered completely from all toxicities including hearing loss which was proven clinically and by audiometry (Figure ) except for a subclinical renal impairment remaining from the acute renal failure (Table). Further antineoplastic therapy was continued with 2 cycles of a carboplatin-based regimen followed by chest irradiation. The patient showed no signs of relapse until March 2003, when a single brain metastasis was discovered and removed by surgery. In September 2003, recurrence of multiple brain metastases was detected and the patient died in January 2004 due to repeated progression of these metastases despite several treatment attempts. During the whole course of disease, no other metastatic sites and no late onset toxicities were observed in the patient."
183,931213,557175,77627,"A 51 year old African-American female, eight years status post colostomy secondary to diverticulitis, presented to the emergency department with a 48 hour complaint of abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. Vitals signs were initially stable, physical exam was significant for distended, tender abdomen. A CT scan revealed extraluminal intraperitoneal air and the patient was taken to the operating room. Exploratory laparotomy revealed an incarcerated peristomal hernia with perforated small bowel. Extensive enterolysis, small bowel resection and hernia repair with permacol were performed. Cultures grew Escherichia coli; pathology revealed only neutrophilic inflammation. Due to the severity of disease, and distention of small bowel, the abdomen was left open to heal by secondary intention. Her postoperative course was complicated by severe sepsis syndrome with respiratory failure, hypotension, leukocytosis, and DIC. Broad spectrum antibiotics were administered. The patient was also treated with hydrocortisone 100 mg every 8 hours and subsequently developed steroid induced hyperglycemia. On postoperative day (POD) 3, a vacuum assisted closure (VAC) device was placed to assist with fascial healing. The sepsis syndrome resolved and the patient's condition improved until POD 9, when stool was noticed collecting within the VAC system. The patient was returned to the operating room where she was found to have an anastamotic breakdown.
Pathology from the second surgery showed transmural ischemic necrosis with angioinvasion of a fungal organism (see figure ). Fungal blood cultures were obtained and the patient was started on amphotericin B lipid complex. Within 48 hours, fungal blood cultures were positive for Penicillium sp. The patient completed a 6 week course of amphotericin B lipid complex, followed by an extended course oral intraconazole. The patient was eventually transferred to a long-term rehabilitation facility, without evidence of recurrent infection. The only identified risk factors for invasive Penicillium infection were stress dose steroids and broad spectrum antibiotics. Final fungal identification demonstrated the organism to be Penicillium chrysogenumA. In vitro susceptibility at 24 and 48 hrs respectively was reported as: amphotericin B 0.5 μg/ml and 1.0 μg/ml, itraconazole 0.06 μg/ml and 0.25 μg/ml, and voriconazole 0.25 μg/ml and 1 μg/mlB."
184,931213,680884,336478,"The patient is a 60-year-old Iranian female referred to our hospital with several-weeks history of abdominal pain, severe pruritus, yellow sclera, light-colored stool, and nausea and vomiting. In addition to fever and chills, she reported intermittent episodes of sustained abdominal pain in the past two months, which worsened by meals and radiating to the right-scapular area. Six years previously, she had undergone cholecystectomy without choledochoenteric anastomosis for symptomatic cholelithiasis.
The patient was a known case of rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes mellitus, her medications consisting of insulin, prednisolone, chloroquine and methotroxate.
On admission, the patient had a temperature of 38.5 C and was noted to have icteric sclera. A right upper quadrant scar was seen on her abdomen. The patient's abdomen was soft and non-distended with normal bowel sounds, albeit tender to deep palpation in the epigastrium and the right upper quadrant. There was no evidence of rebound tenderness or peritoneal signs.
Laboratory data on admission were notable for an elevated total bilirubin of 7.1 mg/dl (nl 0.2–1.1); direct bilirubin of 4.7 mg/dl (nl up to 0.5); alkaline phosphatase of 1217 IU/L (nl 64–306); SGOT of 78 U/L (nl 5–40); and SGPT of 185 U/L (nl 5–40). The total white blood cell count was 10,800 /cmm; prothrombin time was 13 second (nl 10–13) and the c-reactive protein was 2+.
Abdominal ultrasound demonstrated the dilation of the biliary tree with visible choledocholithiasis. Abdominal CT-scan revealed a dilated biliary tract with air entrapment in the lateral side of the right lobe of the liver. The patient subsequently underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The ERCP illustrated multiple stones, the prominent one of which was a 2.5-cm mass. Despite attempts for lithotripsy and sphincterotomy, however, ERCP failed to retrieve all the materials. Therefore, the remaining stone- like objects and materials were successfully removed by means of common bile duct (CBD) exploration (Figure ). Intra-operative findings included multiple stones and a 2.5-cm nonhomogenous mass, impacted in a dilated CBD and having a distorted anatomy due to adhesions, without any signs of previous anastomoses. A drainage T-tube was inserted through CBD. Nine days after the surgery, a post-operative T-tube cholangiography accidentally detected a long choledochoduodenal fistula (Figure ). Since the whole management process from ERCP to T-tube cholangiography did not take more than 3 weeks, both the endoscopist and the surgeon must have failed to detect the fistula because of its overlap with the duodenum and the distorted anatomy.
A histological assessment of the objects removed revealed fibrinoid materials with some cellular debris. The patient remained well during the one-year follow-up."
185,938437,41823,894771,"A 43 years old lady presented to the accident and emergency department with an elbow injury. On examination there was a large subcutaneous haematoma over the olecranon, the skin vascularity was compromised and urgent release of the skin tension was indicated. A radiograph revealed a displaced olecranon fracture but without any bony fragments stretching the skin. The operating theatres were not available for a further 4–5 hours and the patient had just eaten. Due to the presence of a fracture the procedure of surgical incision to evacuate the haematoma within the accident and emergency department setting could bear an unacceptable high risk of infection. Whilst on the other hand waiting for the operating theatres to become available and allowing enough time from the patients last meal for general anaesthesia may result in a large area of skin necrosis overlying a fracture. By using this technique the haematoma was evacuated within 5–10 minutes by the single insertion of a 16 gauge needle. No analgesia was used as the needle was inserted into the edge of skin that was already stretched. Minimal discomfort was felt during evacuation but dramatic pain relief followed from release of the tension. The patient was subsequently admitted for open reduction and internal fixation of the fracture which was performed after 24 hours in optimal conditions."
186,938437,107942,348493,"A 75 years old gentleman presented to the accident and emergency department eight hours after falling onto his knees. Initially he was able to walk but later his mobility became limited due to knee pain not responding to oral analgesia. His knee examination revealed a large haematoma in the prepatella bursa with the overlying skin vascularity compromised and the skin covered with blisters as shown in figure . A radiograph of the knee showed no fractures. The patient was on warfarin due to a previous pulmonary embolism and the lNR level was 3. An urgent evacuation of the haematoma was required to release the tension. However, patient was not starved or prepared for general anaesthesia and the haematoma size was too large for the use of local anaesthesia. Formal incision and drainage with an INR of 3 could trigger a haemorrhage requiring extension of the incision to control the blood loss and accordingly full preparation by blood cross matching and general anaesthesia is then needed. Waiting until the INR is within the operative range will require 24–48 hours and the patient is likely to end up with a large area of skin necrosis. An attempt of simple aspiration of the haematoma by the accident and emergency staff failed. Thus, the technique was used and the tension released within 10 minutes in the accident and emergency department. A compression bandage was applied and the knee was rested for few days in a splint. The case was followed up and there was no evidence of re-collection of the haematoma under tension, skin necrosis or infection. Accordingly formal incision and drainage was not required at a later stage."
187,954495,608427,438071,"A 35-year-old male presented with complaint of mild grade, intermittent fever without chills and rigor and diurnal variation for last 2 months along with occasional dull aching pain in left hypochondriac region. Ultrasonography revealed multiple abscesses in spleen. He was managed on antibiotics for 21 days but fever continued. Computed tomographic (CT) scan of abdomen showed multiple abscesses in spleen without any other significant findings in abdominal organs. Around 200 ml of pus was aspirated under guidance, which was negative for bacteriological examination. He was kept on parenteral antibiotics but did not have any relief.
Color Doppler of heart excluded any possibility of infective endocarditis. X-ray chest was normal. Montoux test was positive up to 11 × 11 mm and he was put on antitubercular treatment to which he did not respond in 6 weeks. Surgical consultation was done and it was decided to proceed with splenectomy.
At laparotomy, there were dense adhesions between the spleen and the adjacent structures and the diaphragm. The patient went into shock after 2 hours of surgery and was resuscitated and taken back to operation theatre for reexploration. Exploration revealed generalized ooze from the area and hemostasis was achieved but again after 2 hours, the patient went into shock and was reexplored again but the patient succumbed to the continued hemorrhage.
Gross specimen measured 18 × 12 × 6 cm and cut surface showed multiple lobulated, solid, well-circumscribed nodules of variable sizes 1 cm to 7 cm diameter with areas of hemorrhage and cystic degeneration replacing most of splenic parenchyma (Figure ). The microscopic examination on Hematoxylin & Eosin stain showed dilated, sinuous vascular channels surrounded by oval to spindle tumor cells having scanty cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei, mitotic figures were occasional (Figure ). There were areas of hemorrhage and cystic degeneration. The Reticulin stain showed intricate reticulum laid down around tumor cells and dilated vascular channels suggestive of hemangiopericytoma (Figure )."
188,954495,894263,822605,"A 3-year-old girl had been treated for a type III left PPB in another institution.

Four years later, she developed, over a week increased vomiting and headaches. A computed tomography of the brain showed a large parietal lobe mass. After performing cerebral and medullar MRI, surgical removal of the tumor was performed. Postoperative computed tomography of the brain showed no residual tumor. Additional exploration for metastasis was negative. Histological diagnosis was PPB type III. She had since received 4 courses of chemotherapy and cerebral radiotherapy was planned to complete treatment. She relapsed 3 months later and was treated with gammaknife radiosurgery. 6 weeks after radiosurgery another cerebral localized relapse occurred. Surgery was performed and another tumour was found on a cerebral MRI 2 months after surgery despite chemotherapy with weekly Navelbine and daily Endoxan. She died shortly after the disease worsened."

190,955517,718370,110222,"A 37-yr-old female presented to a private spine clinic with a chief complaint of episodic neck and back pain. The subject began care while her daughter was being treated for scoliosis in the same clinic. She presented with a past medical history including previous diagnosis and treatment for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Her previous treatment included spinal fusion and Harrington rod instrumentation. Preoperatively, a 58° right thoracic scoliosis was found between T6 and T11. Harrington rod instrumentation reduced the scoliosis to 26°. We were unable to review her medical records pre and post arthrodesis. Although her family history identified a possible genetic component with her daughter's medical history, her preceding family history was negative for scoliosis.
The subject initially filled out a Functional Rating Index. This index, described and tested by Feise et al [], is a combination of the Neck Disability Index and the Oswestry Back Pain Index. This form provides a valid and reliable self-rated assessment of functional improvement in daily activities.
On static visual posture examination, a moderate anterior right shoulder, a protruding right scapula, and a right rib hump were identified. These visual postural findings are used as screening indicators so that unnecessary radiographic studies are not undertaken. Adam's test confirmed the right rib hump on forward bending. This test is classically used in the primary care setting to screen for scoliosis, although its reliability has been called into question [].
The radiographs series consisted of lateral cervical and lumbar views, as well as opposing frontal views. The lateral films were taken to calculate the amount of cervical lordosis, forward head posture, and lumbar lordosis. The cervical lordosis was measured from an angle between 2 lines intersecting the posterior C2 and C7 vertebral bodies. The lumbar lordosis was taken from the angle formed by the intersection of 2 posterior tangent lines drawn from the back of L1 and L5. Preliminary evidence suggests that correcting the sagittal spine before reducing the scoliotic curvature may promote a longer lasting correction [,]. In this case, the initial cervical lordosis measured 23° from C2 to C7, the initial forward head posture measured 31 mm, and the lumbar lordosis measured 31°. Analysis of forward head posture was performed by drawing a vertical line from the posterior inferior corner of C7 upward []. The distance from this line to the posterior superior corner of C2 is measured in millimeters. The initial standing AP radiograph showed a right thoracic scoliosis of 35°, shown in Figure . This measurement was taken from a Cobb angle drawn between the superior endplate of T6 and the inferior endplate of T11. We used a sectional view of the thoracolumbar spine to reduce positional distortion commonly encountered on full-spine films []. The film was taken at a 72"" film to focal distance (FFD) to reduce magnification distortion. For radiographic analytical purposes, we used the positioning and analysis methods outlined by Harrison et al [,-]. These methods have shown good to excellent reliability in terms of patient positioning, and inter- and intra-examiner reliability. Initially, the patient self-rated her back and neck pain as a 7/10 on a numerical pain rating scale.
The Pettibon corrective procedures [] were used in this patient's care plan. The goal of these procedures is to promote a normal [-] sagittal spinal contour. A specific treatment plan was created based upon a trial treatment involving the Pettibon procedures. The patient received bilateral cervical spine traction-type manipulation to mobilize several cervical spinal joints, and then was immediately fitted with a 4-lb Pettibon Headweight. ® The patient walked on a treadmill for 10 minutes while wearing the headweight. After 10 minutes, a follow-up lateral cervical radiograph was taken while wearing the headweight. The purpose of this lateral stress view is to evaluate the potential improvement in cervical lordosis and reduction in forward head posture. Cervical lordosis and forward head posture are again measured on these stress views to evaluate response to treatment. Although earlier studies suggest that a 23° cervical lordosis may also be normal [-], newer research identifies a cervical lordosis closer to the 40° range [,,] Despite this evidence; the concept of a normal cervical lordosis remains a debatable issue. Once it was determined that the patient could benefit by the proposed treatment, a plan was developed and implemented specifically for her. Her plan included once-weekly office visits, with an emphasis on home care exercises to promote patient independence. Each visit consisted of warm-up procedures, manipulation, and rehabilitative exercises.
The warm-up procedures consisted of Pettibon Wobble Chair® Exercises, shown in Figure . The Pettibon Wobble Chair® is a chair designed to isolate the lumbar spine so that core training may take place. The goals of the chair are to promote lumbar stability, muscular coordination, and increase flexibility. However, the benefits of the chair itself remain to be investigated. The Wobble Chair® exercises are performed by holding the head and shoulders still, moving only the pelvic girdle. The exercises consist of a front-to-back motion, a side-to-side motion, and clockwise/counterclockwise circles. Each exercise was performed 20 times, for a total of 80 repetitions at each office visit.
Side-posture lumbopelvic adjustments were delivered bilaterally to mobilize the sacroiliac joints. Cervical spine manipulation was performed by hand in accordance with the radiographic findings. The cervical spine manipulative procedures can be found in the osteopathic literature [].
The rehabilitative included the use of a 4-lb anterior Pettibon Headweight®, a right low shoulderweight, and a left high shoulderweight. An illustration of the weighting system is shown in Figure . During each office visit, the subject wore the headweight and shoulderweights while standing or walking. This exercise was performed for 10 minutes following the manipulative procedures. The patient was instructed to wear the headweight and shoulderweights at home for 20 minutes twice daily. Positional traction, on 2 triangular foam blocks placed at the cervicothoracic and thoracolumbar junctions, was performed once daily immediately before bed for 20 minutes.
After 8 visits in 8 weeks, post radiographs were taken to quantify changes in the sagittal and frontal spinal curves. Additionally, the subject filled out a follow-up Functional Rating Index to compare to the original. The Functional Rating Index score dropped from a 33% disability rating to 8%, and the numerical pain rating scale, rated a 7.0/10 at the onset of care, dropped to a 0/10. The average numerical pain rating scale score over the 8-week span was 3.3 out of 10.
On the post-treatment anteroposterior radiograph, the Cobb angle from T6–T11 was reduced from 35° to 22°. Her cervical lordosis measured 40°, while her forward head posture reduced to 13 mm. The follow-up radiographs were taken at the beginning of the 9th visit prior to treatment, one week after the previous treatment.
A 30-yr-old African-American male presented to a private spine clinic with a chief complaint of chronic mid thoracic pain. The patient had a previous medical diagnosis of Scheuermann's Disease. Moderate wedging was found on previous lateral lumbar and thoracic radiographs at the levels of T7–T10. The patient reported having the back pain consistently over the last 8–10 years, with recurrent episodes of intense myospasms occurring in the paraspinal musculature at the thoracolumbar junction. The patient had been previously managed unsuccessfully with prescription NSAIDS, muscle relaxants, and physical therapy consisting of cryotherapy, electric stimulation, and postural isotonic exercises. The patient could not recall any childhood traumatic events that may have contributed to the vertebral wedging asymmetry.
The subject initially filled out a Functional Rating Index []. We used this form to provide an objective assessment of functional improvement in daily activities. On static visual posture examination, a moderate high and anterior left shoulder and a right rib hump were identified. The paraspinal thoracolumbar musculature had also been significantly developed. Although these factors are not differential for Scheuermann's Disease, they do represent postural abnormalities often associated with scoliosis. Palpatory findings included marked areas of spasticity over the right latissimus dorsi, the left trapezius, the left quadratus lumborum, and the left rhomboid muscles.
Standing anteroposterior and lateral cervical and lumbar radiographs were obtained and analyzed for regional alignment as previously described. Gross radiographic visualization showed a postural swayback positioning, where the pelvis shifts anterior in relation to the thoracic cage. This may result from activation of the pelvo-ocular reflex to compensate for a forward head position []. The initial absolute rotation angles (ARA) from C2–C7 on the lateral cervical view [] and L1–L5 on the lateral lumbar view [] were drawn and measured. Prior to treatment, these angles measured 32° and 55°, respectively. According to Harrison et al, the normal lumbar lordosis should measure 39.7°, with a majority of the lordosis comprised in the L4-S1 region []. Prior to treatment, the forward head posture measured 22 mm, compared to an average normal of <20 mm []. The vertical axis line (VAL), measured from the anterior portion of the sacral base, should intersect the T11/T12 area []. In this case, the patient's VAL was 56 mm anterior to this interspace, consistent with a swayback type of posture. In the coronal views, a left thoracic scoliosis was found between the levels of T1–T5 measuring 22°. Nothing remarkable was found on the AP lumbopelvic.
The patient began an initial treatment plan consisting of 3 weekly visits for 4 weeks. The goals of this initial treatment plan were very specific, including restoring normal sagittal cervical and lumbar curves, reducing forward head posture, and reducing the swayback posture.
The initial 4 weeks of care consisted of manipulative and rehabilitative therapy designed to improve the static alignment of the sagittal spine. These methods are part of the Pettibon system []. The first 12 visits entailed the same procedures in the same order. To begin each visit, the patient performed a series of exercises on a Pettibon Wobble Chair®. This chair is consists of a multiplanar seat that allows the user to perform specific spinopelvic motion patterns. Clinical observation by the authors suggests that these exercises seem to make the manipulative treatment easier on the patient.
In this case, manipulative treatment included bilateral cervical manipulation and anterior thoracic manipulation to mobilize any restricted cervical and/or thoracic segments.
Following the manipulative treatment, the patient was fitted with a Pettibon Headweight® containing 4 lbs on the front of the forehead. The patient walked for 15 minutes while wearing the headweight. After 15 minutes, the patient laid supine on a pair of high-density foam blocks to promote a normal sagittal spinal contour. This was done while lying on an intersegmental traction table for 7 minutes. The patient was prescribed specific home care exercises to be performed daily between visits, and was instructed to walk with the Pettibon Headweight® for 20 minutes twice daily on non-clinic days, and lie on the high-density foam blocks for 20 minutes every night immediately before bed. After 4 weeks, post treatment lateral cervical and lateral lumbar radiographs were taken to quantify improvement in sagittal alignment.
The post lateral cervical showed a 32° cervical lordosis and 5 mm of forward head posture. The post lateral lumbar showed a 44° lumbar lordosis, while the vertical axis line fell 30 mm from the T11/T12 interspace. The 4-week functional rating index improved from a 70% disability to 50% disability, while the numerical pain rating scale dropped from a 9/10 to an 8/10.
Given the presence of bony deformity, we felt that significant time must be spent reducing the asymmetrical loading in the thoracic spine for coronal correction to be achieved. Therefore, the frequency of visits remained at 3 times per week over the next 20 weeks. Over this 20-week period of care, the manipulative treatment remained the same. However, several new rehab procedures were added. The patient still wore the headweight for 15 minutes immediately following the manipulative treatment. After the headweight, the patient worked out on the Pettibon Wobble Chair® while simultaneously performing cephalad traction, demonstrated in Figure . Following this procedure, a specific isometric exercise was performed on a Pettibon Linked Trainer. ® This exercise, shown in Figure , is designed to isolate the right rhomboid muscle. Theoretically, the linked trainer stabilizes the scapula, thereby functionally changing the origin and insertion of the rhomboid. This form of exercise has been previously illustrated with practitioner assistance []. Typically, the function of the rhomboid is to retract the scapula. However, when the scapula is stabilized, now the muscle may effectively pull on its proximal attachment, that being the spinous processes from T5–T8. Therefore, by switching the action of the muscle, our goal was to use the rhomboid to help reduce the left thoracic scoliosis. The patient was instructed to perform this exercise by pulling and holding for 10 seconds, repeating this process until the muscle is sufficiently fatigued. Finally, lateral traction was performed on the thoracic scoliosis using a high-density foam block while in a side-lying position. This block was placed beneath the apex of the scoliotic curvature for 15 minutes. Home care exercises remained the same. However, the frequency of the exercises was dropped to 3 times per week instead of daily. At the conclusion of the 20 weeks, post treatment AP cervicothoracic and lumbopelvic radiographs were taken to quantify improvement. The Cobb angle of the left thoracic scoliosis from T1–T5 reduced to 14°. A comparative view of the pre and post AP cervicothoracic views is shown in Figure . A 20-week functional rating index score dropped to a 28% disability rating, while the numerical pain rating scale dropped to a 6/10.
A 23-year-old female presented with bilateral diffuse neck and lumbodorsal pain, and right-sided scapular and shoulder pain. The pain was constant and sharp in nature with radicular pain into the right arm and elbow. At age 12, her primary care physician diagnosed her with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. At that time, the treatment plan was mainly comprised of observational methods, such as radiographs, visualization, and MRI. About one year before presenting to the primary author's clinic, she was referred for physical therapy by an orthopedic surgeon, which produced little subjective benefit, according to the patient.
On visual examination, a prominent left posterior rib hump was identified. In the frontal plane, she also displayed a marked high left shoulder with anterior rotation. Left anterior pelvic rotation was also well visualized. Given these preliminary findings, along with the positive past history of scoliosis, radiographic imaging was ordered to locate and calculate the nature and severity of the scoliosis. Initial standing 14"" × 17"" sectional radiographs showed a 37° left thoracic scoliosis, measured from the superior endplate of the T3 vertebra and the inferior endplate of the T7 vertebra. She also had a 26° right lumbar scoliosis measured from the superior endplate of T10 and the inferior endplate of L3. In the sagittal plane, her initial cervical lordosis measured 18°, while her lumbar lordosis measured 50°.
The patient began a treatment plan of 3 visits per week for 4 weeks, followed by once weekly visits for 12 weeks. Goals for the first 4 weeks of treatment included: 1) improvement of sagittal spine alignment, 2) reduction in pain and symptoms, and 3) functional improvement. A specific treatment routine was followed at each visit for the first 12 visits.
Each visit began with spinal warm-up exercises performed on a Pettibon Wobble Chair™. The patient then received a brief (less than 15 minutes) session of deep tissue massage therapy applied to the postural muscles. Following these procedures, manipulative intervention took place. The manipulative techniques are collectively taught within the Pettibon technique [], and were employed according to this methodology. First, a posteroanterior high-velocity, low amplitude (HVLA) procedure was applied to mobilize the thoracolumbar region. This was followed by anterior thoracic manipulation to mobilize the cervicothoracic region. A side-lying sacral manipulation was performed bilaterally to mobilize the sacroiliac joints and the lumbosacral joint. Cervical manipulation was performed only on those visits where a supine leg check revealed evidence of leg length inequality (LLI). In the cervical region, an HVLA thrust was applied cranially, thus creating a traction-type adjustive force compared to more traditional shear- or rotary-type cervical manipulative procedures. All of the manipulative techniques are well illustrated and explained by Gibbons and Tehan []. The patient received cervical manipulation in 8 of the first 12 visits.
Immediately following the manipulative intervention, the patient performed her spinal rehabilitative care. In her case, a 4-lb Pettibon Headweight was worn on the front of the head for 10 minutes while maintaining a standing position. Finally, the patient ended each of these visits with the supine positional traction for 7 minutes. The patient was instructed to perform the headweight twice daily between visits for 20-minute intervals. She was also given a set of foam blocks to lie on at night for 20 minutes immediately before bedtime.
After this initial 4-week treatment period, a follow-up radiographic series was obtained, along with a follow-up Functional Rating Index. Comparative radiographic analysis showed a reduced Cobb angle of 29° from T3–T7 and 18° from T10-L3. The sagittal cervical lordosis improved to 32°, while the lumbar lordosis decreased to 45°. The follow-up Functional Rating Index score dropped from 48% to 28% disability.
Following this treatment period, clinical visits dropped to once weekly over the next 12 weeks. During this time, the Pettibon Linked Trainer™ was incorporated into her treatment plan. The Linked Trainer™ exercises were performed after the anterior headweighting procedure at each visit. Dynamic cervical traction was also applied while performing the Pettibon Wobble Chair™ exercises, immediately prior to the spinal manipulative therapy. Finally, a side-lying traction procedure was added to her treatment to help lengthen the soft tissue structures on the concave side of the spinal curvatures. A triangular foam block was placed under the patient's left side, below the apex of the thoracic curvature, while a 25-lb weight was placed above the apex of the lumbar curvature. The patient assumed a left side-lying position during this traction session. This traction maneuver followed the anterior headweighting and the Linked Trainer™ exercises. This procedure was performed for 40 minutes at each office visit as well as at home once daily. The frequency of headweight use at home dropped to 3 days weekly instead of daily.
After 12 weeks of the foregoing treatment, the patient was again re-evaluated using static spinal radiography and the Functional Rating Index. Radiographic analysis demonstrated a 21° left thoracic scoliosis from T3–T7, and a 15° right lumbar scoliosis from T10-L3. Her Functional Rating Index score further reduced to an 18% disability. The patient was asked to continue once daily home treatment consisting of the side-lying traction procedure for 40 minutes, and supine positional traction 20 minutes immediately before bedtime. She was also instructed to continue wearing the anterior headweight at home 3 days a week for 15 minutes per day. After 10 months under this home care regimen, the patient presented for a second follow-up evaluation. At this time, her Functional Rating Index reduced to an 8% disability, while her sagittal cervical and lumbar curves marginally improved to 34° and 42°, respectively. Her left thoracic scoliosis was further reduced to 18°, and her right lumbar scoliosis was maintained at 15°. Therefore, after a total of 4 months of active treatment and 10 months of weekly home care rehabilitation, her spinal curvatures were reduced a total of 19° in the thoracic curvature and 21° in the lumbar curvature. Her pre- and post- radiographs are shown in Figure ."
191,961234,748628,834238,"In 1997, a 55 year-old Vietnamese man was diagnosed with HBV cirrhosis without hepatitis delta virus (HDV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfections. Probably, the route of infection was vertical transmission. Cirrhosis was confirmed by liver biopsy and was complicated only by grade 1 oesophageal varices (Child Pugh score A5). HBe antigen was negative, HBe antibody positive, HBV viral load (HBV-DNA) was 7.15 log10 copies/ml (Digene hybrid capture assay) and the HBV genotype was B. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) values were twice the upper limit of normal (ULN).
In August 1998, lamivudine, 100 mg/day, was started. Three months later, HBV-DNA was undetectable by Digene assay and, in February 1999, by qualitative PCR (sensitivity limit at 4 log10). Lamivudine was inadvertently stopped after only 10 months of treatment, and then started again in January 2000 when a relapse occurred with a rising HBV-DNA to 5.75 log10 and ALT values at 3.1 ULN. The next 2 years of treatment were uneventful with undetectable HBV-DNA by quantitative PCR (cut-off at 2.3 log10, MONITOR COBAS, Roche) and normal ALT values.
In January 2002, after 24 months of uninterrupted lamivudine treatment, HBV-DNA became detectable by PCR (2.6 log10), and, in June 2002, a viral breakthrough was documented when HBV-DNA rose to 9.2 log10 with ALT at 2.7 ULN. The patient was asymptomatic. Sequencing of the HBV polymerase revealed two common lamivudine resistant mutations – rtL180M and rtM204V. Adefovir dipivoxil, 10 mg/day, was added to the ongoing lamivudine treatment. The evolution of HBV viral load is shown in the Figure. Over the next 10 months, HBV-DNA never fell below 5 log10. In June 2003, the HBV-DNA titer was 5.28 log10. Lamivudine was then stopped, but adefovir was maintained; in addition, pegylated interferon α-2a was introduced (180 μg/week). In August 2003, and after five injections, the patient decided to stop pegylated interferon administration due to poor drug tolerance: anorexia, dry mouth, diarrhoea, weight loss and back pain. Thrombopenia was also detected.
After 4 months of uninterrupted adefovir monotherapy, HBV-DNA was still at 4.9 log10 and the same lamivudine resistant mutations were detected without adefovir resistant mutations. In September 2004, while on adefovir monotherapy, and 15 months after having stopped lamivudine and 13 months after having stopped pegylated interferon, HBV-DNA rose to 8.3 log10, ALT to 10 ULN and aspartate aminotransferase to 7 ULN. Prothrombin time was 78%, and total bilirubin and serum albumin were normal. Two adefovir resistant mutations, rtA181T and rtN236T, were detected, whereas previous lamivudine resistant mutations, rtL180M and rtM204V, were absent. Anti-HDV and anti-HCV antibodies detection remained negative.
A test trial of a higher dose of adefovir (20 mg/day) was started. One month later, HBV-DNA was at 7 log10 and ALT levels remained unchanged. The patient's condition deteriorated with the occurrence of oedema, ascites, jaundice, mild renal insufficiency (serum creatinine 110 μmol/l) and decreased prothrombin time (47% of normal). Tenofovir fumarate was then started at a dose of 300 mg/day, while adefovir was continued for one month at 10 mg/day and then stopped. Two months later, HBV-DNA became undetectable by PCR, prothrombin time rose to 90% while jaundice and ascites resolved. HBV-DNA was still undetectable by PCR after 8 months of tenofovir treatment, on three separate occasions. The patient is currently listed for liver transplantation."
192,965888,521393,792947,"The patient, a 27-year-old white male, was referred by a private oral surgeon to our hospital for evaluation of a hard palate lesion that had appeared six months before (Figure ). The lesion had been diagnosed initialing as gingivitis by the private oral surgeon and treated with local topical medicines without any remission.
At the age of seven the patient was recovered for an orthopaedic trauma. He had been diagnosed with FA at the age of seven after that pancytopenia was noticed during routine blood examinations for orthodontic trauma. He had been treated with androgenic therapy and had not received a bone marrow transplant. The haematological test revealed an early stage of pancytopenia (3,4 × 109/l, Hb 12,3 g/dl, and platelets 13 × 109/l).
Oral examination revealed a relatively well-defined, nearly circular, concave ulcer measuring 3 × 4 cm, which extended from the hard palatal mucosa in the upper molar region to the adjacent soft palatal mucosa. The surface was erythematous and smooth, with some telangiectasias. Clinical examination showed no regional lymphadenopathy. CT and MR imaging showed a hard and soft tissue mass extending from molar region mucosa to the soft palate mucosa. The nasopharynx appeared normal (Figure ). No significant cervical lymphadenopathy was seen on the images. An incisional biopsy performed under local anaesthesia revealed a well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (Figure ).
The tumor was surgically removed with a right partial maxillectomy extendiney to homolateral soft mucosa and clear magins. Reconstruction was accomplished with a temporalis muscle flap. The patient has been followed up for 6 months without any evidence of recurrence or metastasis."
193,965888,671696,763372,"A 70 year old lady who had a lumpectomy and axillary sample for a 2.8 cm, grade II, node-negative breast cancer was with her consent, entered into the trial. She was randomised to receive intraoperative radiotherapy as a second procedure. However, the attending anaesthetist felt that because of the history of severe ischaemic heart disease a second general anaesthetic should be avoided. The patient was keen to take the intraoperative radiotherapy to which she was randomised, rather than come every day for radiotherapy for 6 weeks; she was willing to undergo the whole procedure under local anaesthetic.
She received temazepam (10 mg), preoperatively. She was given midazolam 1 mg i.v. just prior to infiltration of the scar (just the skin) with 1% lignocaine with 1:200,000 adrenaline and 0.5% marcaine in a ration of 1:1. During the infiltration she breathed a 50:50 mixture of oxygen and nitrous oxide, followed by oxygen @ 6 L/min via Hudson mask.
The cavity was opened and radiotherapy applicator positioned with a purse string suture as usual. The patient did not feel any pain and tolerated the procedure well (figure ). She remained still during the 22 minutes while radiotherapy (20 Gy at surface) was delivered to the tumour bed (figure ). Postoperative period was uneventful and we discharged home a happy patient."
194,992758,587636,496457,"This otherwise healthy 57 year old woman was referred to an otolaryngologist for evaluation of chronic ear infections and recurrent sinusitis. The otolaryngologist diagnosed chronic sinusitis based on the clinical exam and CT imaging. The planned surgery included bilateral endoscopic ethmoidectomy, bilateral middle meatus antrostomy and left inferior turbinate cautery.
During the right posterior ethmoid exploration, a 2 mm tissue fragment was removed for histopathological analysis. Cerebrospinal fluid was observed leaking from the surgical biopsy site. The apparent opening in the cribriform plate was sealed with gelfoam and the remainder of the procedure completed.
With concern for a CSF leak an unenhanced CT was obtained post-operatively revealing intracranial penetration and hemorrhage (Figure ). The 2 mm tissue sample obtained during the procedure was identified as normal cerebral white matter. In the recovery room, the patient awakened without difficulty in ""satisfactory condition with intact vision.""
Neurosurgical consultation one day after surgery described slight drowsiness and minimal left upper extremity drift. She was empirically started on fosphenytoin and antibiotics. The following day her drift had resolved and she appeared less lethargic.
The remainder of the hospitalization was uncomplicated and she was discharged seven days later after completing her course of antibiotics. She took valproic acid for seizure prophylaxis for several days at home, but this was discontinued due to adverse effects.
An MRI scan two weeks later (Figure ) documented evolution of the hemorrhage. Restricted diffusion along the course of the injury (image not shown) indicated tissue infarction. A brain MRI three months after surgery (Figure ) revealed resolution of the hemorrhage with residual encephalomalacia along the path of injury involving the right caudate, medial internal capsule and anterior right thalamus.
Over the ensuing months the family reported that the patient's personality had changed. They described her as apathetic, mildly depressed, emotionally labile and irritable. She herself complained of having no energy and seemed to have lost interest in life and those activities that had previously stimulated her. Prior to the surgery she had worked full time as an aide in a center for learning disabled children plus an additional 20 hours weekly as an aide in a home health agency. She also was involved extensively with her church and community activities. After recovering from the surgery she was unable to return to work. She would sit at home and do nothing. She did not even wish to drive her car any longer. She also felt that her cognitive abilities had declined significantly. She complained of difficulty with attention and concentration. Although she reported no decline in memory, her family did notice that she was more forgetful.
The patient was evaluated 6 months after the injury by a rehabilitation neuropsychiatrist who found that she was apathetic, had ""blunted and constricted affect"" and specifically showed ""no evidence of neuro-vegetative symptoms of depression."" Based on this assessment, the neuropsychiatrist actually discontinued Prozac treatment started by other physicians and initiated therapy instead with amantadine. The same clinician continued to interact with her until 28 months after surgery and never observed any clinically significant depression. More extensive neuropsychological testing was performed at a different facility 32 months after surgery and concluded again, that the patient's primary cause of cognitive impairment and resultant loss of functionality resulted from an abulic syndrome and not depression. While the patient scored for mild to moderate depression on the Beck Depression Inventory-11, most of the score was based on symptoms that coexist with abulia such as decreased interest in people or activities, loss of pleasure, decreased energy, concentration, motivation and initiative. However, the patient actually scored low on symptoms that are exclusive to depression such as feelings of sadness, worthlessness, guilt and hopelessness. Her apathy, lack of motivation and initiative were the changes that dramatically stood out. Thus it was possible to distinguish clearly between abulia and depression. The ultimate conclusion was that our patient had primary abulia with some depression secondary to her self-perceived change in personality. This fit well with her own assessment. She described her mood as a response to the different person she had become and her inability to live life as she was once able. These neuropsychological tests also revealed other complex functions affected by the injury, namely ""executive dysfunction and mild disinhibition."" The abulia responded partially to amantadine, 100 mg daily, however, the patient reported that if she missed a few doses her difficulties with initiation and motivation would soon return."
